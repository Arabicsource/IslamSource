    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="Quran33" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord.

    <value>And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority."

  <data name="Quran38" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, "Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful."</value>

  <data name="Quran39" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise."</value>

    <value>He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." And when he had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran41" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate before Adam"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.</value>

  <data name="Quran42" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."</value>

  <data name="Quran43" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.</value>

    <value>Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Quran62" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.</value>

    <value>Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran64" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have provided you." And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran65" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [recall] when We said, "Enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward]."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran66" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying.</value>

  <data name="Quran67" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, "Strike with your staff the stone."

"Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."</value>

  <data name="Quran68" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food.

[Moses] said, "Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked." And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran69" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muhammad] - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran70" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], "Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous."</value>

  <data name="Quran71" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="Quran73" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear Allah.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran74" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Do you take us in ridicule?" He said, "I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran75" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is." [Moses] said, "[Allah] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran76" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color." He said, "He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.' "</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran77" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if Allah wills, will be guided."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran78" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.' " They said, "Now you have come with the truth." So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran79" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed over it, but Allah was to bring out that which you were concealing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran80" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, We said, "Strike the slain man with part of it." Thus does Allah bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran81" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran82" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Torah after they had understood it while they were knowing?</value>

    <value>We had already taken the covenant of the Children of Israel and had sent to them messengers. Whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire, a party [of messengers] they denied, and another party they killed.</value>

  <data name="Quran740" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Then Allah turned to them in forgiveness; then [again] many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.</value>

  <data name="Quran741" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They have certainly disbelieved who say, "Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary" while the Messiah has said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord."

  </data>
  <data name="Quran742" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They have certainly disbelieved who say, "Allah is the third of three." And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.</value>

    <value>The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.</value>

    <value>Say, "O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way."</value>

  <data name="Quran747" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed.</value>

    <value>They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did. How wretched was that which they were doing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran749" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You see many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved. How wretched is that which they have put forth for themselves in that Allah has become angry with them, and in the punishment they will abide eternally.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran750" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and in what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as allies; but many of them are defiantly disobedient.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran751" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians." That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran752" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say, "Our Lord, we have believed, so register us among the witnesses.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran753" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And why should we not believe in Allah and what has come to us of the truth? And we aspire that our Lord will admit us [to Paradise] with the righteous people."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran754" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So Allah rewarded them for what they said with gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of doers of good.</value>

    <value>There is not upon those who believe and do righteousness [any] blame concerning what they have eaten [in the past] if they [now] fear Allah and believe and do righteous deeds, and then fear Allah and believe, and then fear Allah and do good; and Allah loves the doers of good.</value>

Allah has pardoned what is past; but whoever returns [to violation], then Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.</value>

    <value>O you who have believed, testimony [should be taken] among you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest - [that of] two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you. Detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by Allah if you doubt [their testimony, saying], "We will not exchange our oath for a price, even if he should be a near relative, and we will not withhold the testimony of Allah.

  <data name="Quran1103" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, "How wretched is that by which you have replaced me after [my departure].

    <value>And ask them about the town that was by the sea - when they transgressed in [the matter of] the sabbath - when their fish came to them openly on their sabbath day, and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them.

    <value>[Of these stories mention] when Joseph said to his father, "O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1601" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan. Indeed Satan, to man, is a manifest enemy.</value>

    <value>And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1603" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Certainly were there in Joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1604" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When they said, "Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a clan. Indeed, our father is in clear error.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1605" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance of your father will [then] be only for you, and you will be after that a righteous people."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1606" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Said a speaker among them, "Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - if you would do [something]."</value>

  <data name="Quran1607" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while indeed, we are to him sincere counselors?</value>

  <data name="Quran1608" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. And indeed, we will be his guardians.</value>

  <data name="Quran1609" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Jacob] said, "Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware."</value>

  <data name="Quran1610" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan, indeed, we would then be losers."</value>

  <data name="Quran1611" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So when they took him [out] and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well... But We inspired to him, "You will surely inform them [someday] about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive [your identity]."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1612" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they came to their father at night, weeping.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1613" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "O our father, indeed we went racing each other and left Joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1614" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they brought upon his shirt false blood. [Jacob] said, "Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. And Allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1615" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, "Good news! Here is a boy." And they concealed him, [taking him] as merchandise; and Allah was knowing of what they did.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1616" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they sold him for a reduced price - a few dirhams - and they were, concerning him, of those content with little.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1617" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the one from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, "Make his residence comfortable. Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son."

  </data>
  <data name="Quran1618" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when Joseph reached maturity, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus We reward the doers of good.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1619" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, "Come, you." He said, "[I seek] the refuge of Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1620" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1621" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, "What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1622" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Joseph] said, "It was she who sought to seduce me." And a witness from her family testified. "If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1623" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1624" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, "Indeed, it is of the women's plan. Indeed, your plan is great.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1625" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Joseph, ignore this. And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1626" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And women in the city said, "The wife of al-'Azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love. Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1627" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], "Come out before them." And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said, "Perfect is Allah! This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1628" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>She said, "That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1629" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1630" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1631" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that al-'Azeez should surely imprison him for a time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1632" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said, "Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing wine." The other said, "Indeed, I have seen myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1633" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "You will not receive food that is provided to you except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1634" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with Allah. That is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon the people, but most of the people are not grateful.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1635" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1636" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Legislation is not but for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1637" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give drink to his master of wine; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter has been decreed about which you both inquire."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1638" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, "Mention me before your master." But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and Joseph remained in prison several years.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1639" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [subsequently] the king said, "Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry. O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1640" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "[It is but] a mixture of false dreams, and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1641" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But the one who was freed and remembered after a time said, "I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1642" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[He said], "Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry - that I may return to the people; perhaps they will know [about you]."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1643" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Joseph] said, "You will plant for seven years consecutively; and what you harvest leave in its spikes, except a little from which you will eat.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1644" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consume what you saved for them, except a little from which you will store.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1645" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press [olives and grapes]."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1646" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the king said, "Bring him to me." But when the messenger came to him, [Joseph] said, "Return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plan."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1647" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Said [the king to the women], "What was your condition when you sought to seduce Joseph?" They said, "Perfect is Allah! We know about him no evil." The wife of al-'Azeez said, "Now the truth has become evident. It was I who sought to seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1648" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That is so al-'Azeez will know that I did not betray him in [his] absence and that Allah does not guide the plan of betrayers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1649" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil, except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1650" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the king said, "Bring him to me; I will appoint him exclusively for myself." And when he spoke to him, he said, "Indeed, you are today established [in position] and trusted."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1651" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Joseph] said, "Appoint me over the storehouses of the land. Indeed, I will be a knowing guardian."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1652" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.</value>

  <data name="Quran1653" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing Allah.</value>

    <value>And the brothers of Joseph came [seeking food], and they entered upon him; and he recognized them, but he was to them unknown.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1655" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when he had furnished them with their supplies, he said, "Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do not you see that I give full measure and that I am the best of accommodators?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1656" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But if you do not bring him to me, no measure will there be [hereafter] for you from me, nor will you approach me."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1657" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "We will attempt to dissuade his father from [keeping] him, and indeed, we will do [it]."</value>

  <data name="Quran1658" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [Joseph] said to his servants, "Put their merchandise into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will [again] return."</value>

  <data name="Quran1659" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father, [further] measure has been denied to us, so send with us our brother [that] we will be given measure. And indeed, we will be his guardians."</value>

  <data name="Quran1660" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "Should I entrust you with him except [under coercion] as I entrusted you with his brother before? But Allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1661" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, "O our father, what [more] could we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us. And we will obtain supplies for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load; that is an easy measurement."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1662" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Jacob] said, "Never will I send him with you until you give me a promise by Allah that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you should be surrounded by enemies." And when they had given their promise, he said, "Allah, over what we say, is Witness."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1663" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he said, "O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates; and I cannot avail you against [the decree of] Allah at all. The decision is only for Allah; upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely [indeed] rely."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1664" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when they entered from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them against Allah at all except [it was] a need within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied.

  </data>
  <data name="Quran1665" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself; he said, "Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they used to do [to me]."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1666" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer called out, "O caravan, indeed you are thieves."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran1667" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said while approaching them, "What is it you are missing?"</value>

  <data name="Quran1668" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "We are missing the measure of the king. And for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am responsible for it."</value>

  <data name="Quran1669" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "By Allah, you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves."</value>

  <data name="Quran1670" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The accusers said, "Then what would be its recompense if you should be liars?"</value>

  <data name="Quran1672" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother. Thus did We plan for Joseph.

  <data name="Quran1673" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before." But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, "You are worse in position, and Allah is most knowing of what you describe."</value>

  <data name="Quran2149" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2150" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Mention] when the youths retreated to the cave and said, "Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2151" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So We cast [a cover of sleep] over their ears within the cave for a number of years.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2152" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then We awakened them that We might show which of the two factions was most precise in calculating what [extent] they had remained in time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2153" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is We who relate to you, [O Muhammad], their story in truth. Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2154" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We made firm their hearts when they stood up and said, "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never will we invoke besides Him any deity. We would have certainly spoken, then, an excessive transgression.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2155" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These, our people, have taken besides Him deities. Why do they not bring for [worship of] them a clear authority? And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah a lie?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2156" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[The youths said to one another], "And when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than Allah, retreat to the cave. Your Lord will spread out for you of His mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2157" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [had you been present], you would see the sun when it rose, inclining away from their cave on the right, and when it set, passing away from them on the left, while they were [laying] within an open space thereof. That was from the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is the [rightly] guided, but he whom He leaves astray - never will you find for him a protecting guide.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2158" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And you would think them awake, while they were asleep. And We turned them to the right and to the left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. If you had looked at them, you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2159" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And similarly, We awakened them that they might question one another. Said a speaker from among them, "How long have you remained [here]?" They said, "We have remained a day or part of a day." They said, "Your Lord is most knowing of how long you remained. So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious. And let no one be aware of you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2160" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, if they come to know of you, they will stone you or return you to their religion. And never would you succeed, then - ever."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2161" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And similarly, We caused them to be found that they [who found them] would know that the promise of Allah is truth and that of the Hour there is no doubt. [That was] when they disputed among themselves about their affair and [then] said, "Construct over them a structure. Their Lord is most knowing about them." Said those who prevailed in the matter, "We will surely take [for ourselves] over them a masjid."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2162" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They will say there were three, the fourth of them being their dog; and they will say there were five, the sixth of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were seven, and the eighth of them was their dog. Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument and do not inquire about them among [the speculators] from anyone."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2163" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2164" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Except [when adding], "If Allah wills." And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2165" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they remained in their cave for three hundred years and exceeded by nine.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2166" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Say, "Allah is most knowing of how long they remained. He has [knowledge of] the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. How Seeing is He and how Hearing! They have not besides Him any protector, and He shares not His legislation with anyone."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2167" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no changer of His words, and never will you find in other than Him a refuge.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2168" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2169" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And say, "The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve." Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2170" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2171" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Those will have gardens of perpetual residence; beneath them rivers will flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining therein on adorned couches. Excellent is the reward, and good is the resting place.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2172" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And present to them an example of two men: We granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them with palm trees and placed between them [fields of] crops.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2173" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything. And We caused to gush forth within them a river.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2174" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he had fruit, so he said to his companion while he was conversing with him, "I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in [numbers of] men."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2175" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said, "I do not think that this will perish - ever.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2176" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And I do not think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2177" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>His companion said to him while he was conversing with him, "Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust and then from a sperm-drop and then proportioned you [as] a man?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2178" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But as for me, He is Allah, my Lord, and I do not associate with my Lord anyone.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2179" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And why did you, when you entered your garden, not say, 'What Allah willed [has occurred]; there is no power except in Allah '? Although you see me less than you in wealth and children,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2180" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It may be that my Lord will give me [something] better than your garden and will send upon it a calamity from the sky, and it will become a smooth, dusty ground,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2181" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Or its water will become sunken [into the earth], so you would never be able to seek it."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2182" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And his fruits were encompassed [by ruin], so he began to turn his hands about [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, while it had collapsed upon its trellises, and said, "Oh, I wish I had not associated with my Lord anyone."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2183" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And there was for him no company to aid him other than Allah, nor could he defend himself.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2184" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There the authority is [completely] for Allah, the Truth. He is best in reward and best in outcome.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2185" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And present to them the example of the life of this world, [its being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds. And Allah is ever, over all things, Perfect in Ability.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2186" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for [one's] hope.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2187" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [warn of] the Day when We will remove the mountains and you will see the earth prominent, and We will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2188" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they will be presented before your Lord in rows, [and He will say], "You have certainly come to Us just as We created you the first time. But you claimed that We would never make for you an appointment."</value>

  <data name="Quran2189" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, "Oh, woe to us!

  </data>
  <data name="Quran2190" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord.

  </data>
  <data name="Quran2191" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves, and I would not have taken the misguiders as assistants.</value>

  <data name="Quran2192" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [warn of] the Day when He will say, "Call 'My partners' whom you claimed," and they will invoke them, but they will not respond to them. And We will put between them [a valley of] destruction.</value>

  <data name="Quran2193" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the criminals will see the Fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein. And they will not find from it a way elsewhere.</value>

    <value>And We have certainly diversified in this Qur'an for the people from every [kind of] example; but man has ever been, most of anything, [prone to] dispute.</value>

  <data name="Quran2195" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And nothing has prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that there [must] befall them the [accustomed] precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment should come [directly] before them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2196" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners. And those who disbelieve dispute by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalidate thereby the truth and have taken My verses, and that of which they are warned, in ridicule.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2197" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth? Indeed, We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if you invite them to guidance - they will never be guided, then - ever.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2198" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And your Lord is the Forgiving, full of mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them for what they earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment. Rather, for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape.</value>

    <value>And [mention] when Moses said to his servant, "I will not cease [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2201" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But when they reached the junction between them, they forgot their fish, and it took its course into the sea, slipping away.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2202" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So when they had passed beyond it, [Moses] said to his boy, "Bring us our morning meal. We have certainly suffered in this, our journey, [much] fatigue."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2203" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "Did you see when we retired to the rock? Indeed, I forgot [there] the fish. And none made me forget it except Satan - that I should mention it. And it took its course into the sea amazingly".</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2204" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Moses] said, "That is what we were seeking." So they returned, following their footprints.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2205" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they found a servant from among Our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from Us a [certain] knowledge.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2206" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Moses said to him, "May I follow you on [the condition] that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2207" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience.</value>

    <value>And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?"</value>

    <value>He said, "Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I make to you about it mention."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2211" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, al-Khidh r tore it open. [Moses] said, "Have you torn it open to drown its people? You have certainly done a grave thing."</value>

  <data name="Quran2212" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Al-Khidh r] said, "Did I not say that with me you would never be able to have patience?"</value>

    <value>So they set out, until when they met a boy, al-Khidh r killed him. [Moses] said, "Have you killed a pure soul for other than [having killed] a soul? You have certainly done a deplorable thing."</value>

  <data name="Quran2215" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Al-Khidh r] said, "Did I not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience?"</value>

    <value>[Moses] said, "If I should ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me as a companion. You have obtained from me an excuse."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2217" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so al-Khidh r restored it. [Moses] said, "If you wished, you could have taken for it a payment."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2218" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Al-Khidh r] said, "This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2219" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. So I intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every [good] ship by force.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2220" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2221" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2222" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous. So your Lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2223" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about Dhul-Qarnayn. Say, "I will recite to you about him a report."</value>

    <value>Indeed We established him upon the earth, and We gave him to everything a way.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Quran2226" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it [as if] setting in a spring of dark mud, and he found near it a people. Allah said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, either you punish [them] or else adopt among them [a way of] goodness."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2227" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "As for one who wrongs, we will punish him. Then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a terrible punishment.</value>

    <value>Then he followed a way</value>

    <value>Thus. And We had encompassed [all] that he had in knowledge.</value>

    <value>They said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are [great] corrupters in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between us and them a barrier?"</value>

  <data name="Quran2235" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "That in which my Lord has established me is better [than what you offer], but assist me with strength; I will make between you and them a dam.</value>

  <data name="Quran2236" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Bring me sheets of iron" - until, when he had leveled [them] between the two mountain walls, he said, "Blow [with bellows]," until when he had made it [like] fire, he said, "Bring me, that I may pour over it molten copper."</value>

  <data name="Quran2261" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So he came out to his people from the prayer chamber and signaled to them to exalt [Allah] in the morning and afternoon.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2262" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Allah] said, "O John, take the Scripture with determination." And We gave him judgement [while yet] a boy</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2263" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And affection from Us and purity, and he was fearing of Allah</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2264" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And dutiful to his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2265" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2266" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And mention, [O Muhammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2267" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2268" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2269" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2270" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2271" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.' "</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2272" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2273" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, "Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2274" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But he called her from below her, "Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2275" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2276" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.' "</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2277" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, "O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2278" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2279" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So she pointed to him. They said, "How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2280" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2281" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2282" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2283" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2284" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2285" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is not [befitting] for Allah to take a son; exalted is He! When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2286" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Jesus said], "And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2287" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then the factions differed [concerning Jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbelieved - from the scene of a tremendous Day.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2288" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How [clearly] they will hear and see the Day they come to Us, but the wrongdoers today are in clear error.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2289" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded; and [yet], they are in [a state of] heedlessness, and they do not believe.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2290" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, it is We who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it, and to Us they will be returned.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2291" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2292" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Mention] when he said to his father, "O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2293" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2294" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O my father, do not worship Satan. Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2295" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion [in Hellfire]."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2296" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[His father] said, "Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a prolonged time."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2297" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Abraham] said, "Peace will be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2298" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And I will leave you and those you invoke other than Allah and will invoke my Lord. I expect that I will not be in invocation to my Lord unhappy."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2299" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So when he had left them and those they worshipped other than Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2300" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We gave them of Our mercy, and we made for them a reputation of high honor.</value>
  </data>

  </data>
  <data name="Quran2303" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2304" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And mention in the Book, Ishmael. Indeed, he was true to his promise, and he was a messenger and a prophet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2305" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zakah and was to his Lord pleasing.</value>

    <value>And We raised him to a high station.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2308" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Those were the ones upon whom Allah bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of Adam and of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell in prostration and weeping.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2309" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But there came after them successors who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil -</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2310" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2311" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Therein are] gardens of perpetual residence which the Most Merciful has promised His servants in the unseen. Indeed, His promise has ever been coming.</value>

  <data name="Quran2312" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They will not hear therein any ill speech - only [greetings of] peace - and they will have their provision therein, morning and afternoon.</value>

  <data name="Quran2313" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That is Paradise, which We give as inheritance to those of Our servants who were fearing of Allah.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2314" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Gabriel said], "And we [angels] descend not except by the order of your Lord. To Him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between. And never is your Lord forgetful -</value>

    <value>Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - so worship Him and have patience for His worship. Do you know of any similarity to Him?"</value>

  <data name="Quran2316" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the disbeliever says, "When I have died, am I going to be brought forth alive?"</value>

    <value>Does man not remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?</value>

  <data name="Quran2318" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their knees.</value>

    <value>Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the Most Merciful in insolence.</value>

    <value>Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2323" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of [our] two parties is best in position and best in association?"</value>

    <value>And how many a generation have We destroyed before them who were better in possessions and [outward] appearance?</value>

    <value>Say, "Whoever is in error - let the Most Merciful extend for him an extension [in wealth and time] until, when they see that which they were promised - either punishment [in this world] or the Hour [of resurrection] - they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2326" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And Allah increases those who were guided, in guidance, and the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for recourse.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2327" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then, have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, "I will surely be given wealth and children [in the next life]?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2328" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise?</value>

    <value>No! We will record what he says and extend for him from the punishment extensively.</value>

  <data name="Quran2341" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2342" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2343" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.</value>

    <value>[It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky, rain and produced thereby categories of various plants.</value>

    <value>Eat [therefrom] and pasture your livestock. Indeed, in that are signs for those of intelligence.</value>

  <data name="Quran2404" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We certainly showed Pharaoh Our signs - all of them - but he denied and refused.</value>

  <data name="Quran2405" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?</value>

  <data name="Quran2406" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then we will surely bring you magic like it, so make between us and you an appointment, which we will not fail to keep and neither will you, in a place assigned."</value>

  <data name="Quran2407" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Moses] said, "Your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at mid-morning."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2408" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So Pharaoh went away, put together his plan, and then came [to Moses].</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2409" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Moses said to the magicians summoned by Pharaoh, "Woe to you! Do not invent a lie against Allah or He will exterminate you with a punishment; and he has failed who invents [such falsehood]."</value>

  <data name="Quran2410" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation.</value>

  <data name="Quran2411" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "Indeed, these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way.</value>

  <data name="Quran2412" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So resolve upon your plan and then come [forward] in line. And he has succeeded today who overcomes."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2413" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2414" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "Rather, you throw." And suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving [like snakes].</value>

  <data name="Quran2415" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he sensed within himself apprehension, did Moses.</value>

    <value>Allah said, "Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2417" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. What they have crafted is but the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he is."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2418" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2419" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Pharaoh] said, "You believed him before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us is more severe in [giving] punishment and more enduring."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2420" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "Never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and [over] He who created us. So decree whatever you are to decree. You can only decree for this worldly life.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2421" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic. And Allah is better and more enduring."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2422" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - indeed, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live.</value>

    <value>Gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of one who purifies himself.</value>

  <data name="Quran2425" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We had inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea; you will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning]."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2426" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered them from the sea that which covered them,</value>

  <data name="Quran2427" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them].</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2428" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quails,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2429" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have provided you and do not transgress [or oppress others] therein, lest My anger should descend upon you. And he upon whom My anger descends has certainly fallen."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2430" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2431" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Allah] said, "And what made you hasten from your people, O Moses?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2432" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "They are close upon my tracks, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You be pleased."</value>

  <data name="Quran2433" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Allah] said, "But indeed, We have tried your people after you [departed], and the Samiri has led them astray."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2434" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved. He said, "O my people, did your Lord not make you a good promise?

  </data>
  <data name="Quran2435" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "We did not break our promise to you by our will, but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people [of Pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thus did the Samiri throw."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2436" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he extracted for them [the statue of] a calf which had a lowing sound, and they said, "This is your god and the god of Moses, but he forgot."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2437" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2438" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And Aaron had already told them before [the return of Moses], "O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2439" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They said, "We will never cease being devoted to the calf until Moses returns to us."</value>

  <data name="Quran2440" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Moses] said, "O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,</value>

    <value>From following me? Then have you disobeyed my order?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2442" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Aaron] said, "O son of my mother, do not seize [me] by my beard or by my head. Indeed, I feared that you would say, 'You caused division among the Children of Israel, and you did not observe [or await] my word.' "</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2443" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Moses] said, "And what is your case, O Samiri?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2444" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the track of the messenger and threw it, and thus did my soul entice me."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2445" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Moses] said, "Then go. And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, 'No contact.' And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep.

  <data name="Quran2447" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Thus, [O Muhammad], We relate to you from the news of what has preceded. And We have certainly given you from Us the Qur'an.</value>

  <data name="Quran2448" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Whoever turns away from it - then indeed, he will bear on the Day of Resurrection a burden,</value>

    <value>We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner will say, "You remained not but one day."</value>

    <value>You will not see therein a depression or an elevation."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2456" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That Day, everyone will follow [the call of] the Caller [with] no deviation therefrom, and [all] voices will be stilled before the Most Merciful, so you will not hear except a whisper [of footsteps].</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2457" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That Day, no intercession will benefit except [that of] one to whom the Most Merciful has given permission and has accepted his word.</value>

  <data name="Quran2458" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Allah knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, but they do not encompass it in knowledge.</value>

    <value>But he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer - he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation.</value>

  <data name="Quran2461" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid [sin] or it would cause them remembrance.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2462" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So high [above all] is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth. And, [O Muhammad], do not hasten with [recitation of] the Qur'an before its revelation is completed to you, and say, "My Lord, increase me in knowledge."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2463" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.</value>

  <data name="Quran2464" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except Iblees; he refused.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2465" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So We said, "O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer.</value>

  <data name="Quran2466" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed.</value>

    <value>And indeed, you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2468" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then Satan whispered to him; he said, "O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2469" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And Adam and his wife ate of it, and their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and erred.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2470" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him].</value>

  <data name="Quran2471" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Allah] said, "Descend from Paradise - all, [your descendants] being enemies to one another. And if there should come to you guidance from Me - then whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the Hereafter].</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2472" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind."</value>

  <data name="Quran2473" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He will say, "My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I was [once] seeing?"</value>

    <value>[Allah] will say, "Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot them; and thus will you this Day be forgotten."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2475" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2476" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then, has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2477" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord, punishment would have been an obligation [due immediately], and [if not for] a specified term [decreed].</value>

  <data name="Quran2478" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So be patient over what they say and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and during periods of the night [exalt Him] and at the ends of the day, that you may be satisfied.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2479" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them. And the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2480" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not for provision; We provide for you, and the [best] outcome is for [those of] righteousness.</value>

    <value>And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, "Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced?"</value>

    <value>But the ones who strove against Our verses, [seeking] to cause failure - those are the companions of Hellfire.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2647" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in; then Allah makes precise His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2648" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[That is] so He may make what Satan throws in a trial for those within whose hearts is disease and those hard of heart. And indeed, the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2649" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And so those who were given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord and [therefore] believe in it, and their hearts humbly submit to it. And indeed is Allah the Guide of those who have believed to a straight path.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2650" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>[All] sovereignty that Day is for Allah; He will judge between them. So they who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the Gardens of Pleasure.</value>

    <value>And they who disbelieved and denied Our signs - for those there will be a humiliating punishment.</value>

  <data name="Quran2653" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And those who emigrated for the cause of Allah and then were killed or died - Allah will surely provide for them a good provision. And indeed, it is Allah who is the best of providers.</value>

  <data name="Quran2654" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He will surely cause them to enter an entrance with which they will be pleased, and indeed, Allah is Knowing and Forbearing.</value>

  <data name="Quran2655" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That [is so]. And whoever responds [to injustice] with the equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is tyrannized - Allah will surely aid him. Indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2656" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That is because Allah causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2657" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand.</value>

    <value>Do you not see that Allah has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes green? Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted.</value>

    <value>To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. And indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.</value>

    <value>Do you not see that Allah has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by His command? And He restrains the sky from falling upon the earth, unless by His permission. Indeed Allah, to the people, is Kind and Merciful.</value>

    <value>For every religion We have appointed rites which they perform. So, [O Muhammad], let the disbelievers not contend with you over the matter but invite them to your Lord. Indeed, you are upon straight guidance.</value>

    <value>And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval.

[It is] the Fire which Allah has promised those who disbelieve, and wretched is the destination."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran2668" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>O people, an example is presented, so listen to it. Indeed, those you invoke besides Allah will never create [as much as] a fly, even if they gathered together for that purpose.

    <value>They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.</value>

    <value>And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. Allah named you "Muslims" before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to Allah. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.</value>

    <value>Certainly will the believers have succeeded:</value>

    <value>Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging.</value>

    <value>Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators.</value>

    <value>And We brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from which you eat.</value>

    <value>And [We brought forth] a tree issuing from Mount Sinai which produces oil and food for those who eat.</value>

    <value>But the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, "This is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to take precedence over you; and if Allah had willed [to send a messenger], He would have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among our forefathers.</value>

    <value>He is not but a man possessed with madness, so wait concerning him for a time."</value>

    <value>So We inspired to him, "Construct the ship under Our observation, and Our inspiration, and when Our command comes and the oven overflows, put into the ship from each [creature] two mates and your family, except those for whom the decree [of destruction] has proceeded.

  </data>
  <data name="Quran2701" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when you have boarded the ship, you and those with you, then say, 'Praise to Allah who has saved us from the wrongdoing people.'</value>

    <value>Indeed in that are signs, and indeed, We are ever testing [Our servants].</value>

    <value>Then We produced after them a generation of others.</value>

    <value>And the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter while We had given them luxury in the worldly life said, "This is not but a man like yourselves. He eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink.</value>

  <data name="Quran2707" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="Quran2718" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority</value>

  <data name="Quran3256" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters.</value>

  <data name="Quran3257" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors</value>

  <data name="Quran3258" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and [his minister] Haman and their soldiers through them that which they had feared.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3259" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We inspired to the mother of Moses, "Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3260" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3261" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the wife of Pharaoh said, "[He will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3262" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the heart of Moses' mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3263" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And she said to his sister, "Follow him"; so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not.</value>

  <data name="Quran3264" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before, so she said, "Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?"</value>

  <data name="Quran3265" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So We restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of the people do not know.</value>

    <value>And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] mature, We bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good.</value>

  <data name="Quran3267" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemy.

Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3268" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me," and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Quran3271" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he said, "O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3272" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, "O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [intending] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisors."</value>

  <data name="Quran3273" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way."</value>

  <data name="Quran3275" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when he came to the well of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women driving back [their flocks].

  </data>
  <data name="Quran3276" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, "My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3277" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, "Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us." So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, "Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3278" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One of the women said, "O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3279" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you.

  <data name="Quran3280" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="Quran3281" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire.

  </data>
  <data name="Quran3282" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot - from the tree, "O Moses, indeed I am Allah, Lord of the worlds."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3283" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [he was told], "Throw down your staff." But when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], "O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3284" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white, without disease.

  </data>
  <data name="Quran3285" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He said, "My Lord, indeed, I killed from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me.</value>

  <data name="Quran3287" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Allah] said, "We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant."</value>

  <data name="Quran3288" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But when Moses came to them with Our signs as clear evidences, they said, "This is not except invented magic, and we have not heard of this [religion] among our forefathers."</value>

    <value>And Moses said, "My Lord is more knowing [than we or you] of who has come with guidance from Him and to whom will be succession in the home. Indeed, wrongdoers do not succeed."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3290" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And Pharaoh said, "O eminent ones, I have not known you to have a god other than me. Then ignite for me, O Haman, [a fire] upon the clay and make for me a tower that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I do think he is among the liars."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran3291" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>[He said], "Return them to me," and set about striking [their] legs and necks.</value>

    <value>And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - those of strength and [religious] vision.</value>

  <data name="Quran4294" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned, and it will [certainly] befall them. And those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens [in Paradise] having whatever they will in the presence of their Lord. That is what is the great bounty.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4295" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is that of which Allah gives good tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, [O Muhammad], "I do not ask you for this message any payment [but] only good will through kinship." And whoever commits a good deed - We will increase for him good therein. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4296" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Or do they say, "He has invented about Allah a lie"? But if Allah willed, He could seal over your heart. And Allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by His words. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4297" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And it is He who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4298" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And He answers [the supplication of] those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases [for] them from His bounty. But the disbelievers will have a severe punishment.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4299" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4300" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4301" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And of his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what He has dispersed throughout them of creatures. And He, for gathering them when He wills, is competent.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4302" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4303" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And you will not cause failure [to Allah] upon the earth. And you have not besides Allah any protector or helper.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4304" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And of His signs are the ships in the sea, like mountains.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4305" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If He willed, He could still the wind, and they would remain motionless on its surface. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4306" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Or He could destroy them for what they earned; but He pardons much.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4307" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [that is so] those who dispute concerning Our signs may know that for them there is no place of escape.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4308" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So whatever thing you have been given - it is but [for] enjoyment of the worldly life. But what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their Lord rely</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4309" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, and when they are angry, they forgive,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4310" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves, and from what We have provided them, they spend.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4311" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And those who, when tyranny strikes them, they defend themselves,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4312" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation - his reward is [due] from Allah. Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4313" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And whoever avenges himself after having been wronged - those have not upon them any cause [for blame].</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4314" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right. Those will have a painful punishment.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4315" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And whoever is patient and forgives - indeed, that is of the matters [requiring] determination.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4316" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no protector beyond Him. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, "Is there for return [to the former world] any way?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4317" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And you will see them being exposed to the Fire, humbled from humiliation, looking from [behind] a covert glance. And those who had believed will say, "Indeed, the [true] losers are the ones who lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4318" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And there will not be for them any allies to aid them other than Allah. And whoever Allah sends astray - for him there is no way.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4319" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from Allah of which there is no repelling. No refuge will you have that day, nor for you will there be any denial.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4320" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But if they turn away - then We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], over them as a guardian; upon you is only [the duty of] notification. And indeed, when We let man taste mercy from us, he rejoices in it; but if evil afflicts him for what his hands have put forth, then indeed, man is ungrateful.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4321" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; He creates what he wills. He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4322" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Or He makes them [both] males and females, and He renders whom He wills barren. Indeed, He is Knowing and Competent.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4323" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And it is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission, what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4324" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or [what is] faith, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants. And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path -</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4325" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The path of Allah, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Unquestionably, to Allah do [all] matters evolve.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4326" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ha, Meem.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4327" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>By the clear Book,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4328" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, We have made it an Arabic Qur'an that you might understand.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4329" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And indeed it is, in the Mother of the Book with Us, exalted and full of wisdom.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4330" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then should We turn the message away, disregarding you, because you are a transgressing people?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4331" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And how many a prophet We sent among the former peoples,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4332" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But there would not come to them a prophet except that they used to ridicule him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4333" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We destroyed greater than them in [striking] power, and the example of the former peoples has preceded.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4334" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And if you should ask them, "Who has created the heavens and the earth?" they would surely say, "They were created by the Exalted in Might, the Knowing."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4335" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[The one] who has made for you the earth a bed and made for you upon it roads that you might be guided</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4336" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And who sends down rain from the sky in measured amounts, and We revive thereby a dead land - thus will you be brought forth -</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4337" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And who created the species, all of them, and has made for you of ships and animals those which you mount.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4338" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That you may settle yourselves upon their backs and then remember the favor of your Lord when you have settled upon them and say. "Exalted is He who has subjected this to us, and we could not have [otherwise] subdued it.</value>

    <value>And indeed we, to our Lord, will [surely] return."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4340" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But they have attributed to Him from His servants a portion. Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4341" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Or has He taken, out of what He has created, daughters and chosen you for [having] sons?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4342" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attributes to the Most Merciful in comparison, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.</value>

  <data name="Quran4343" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So is one brought up in ornaments while being during conflict unevident [attributed to Allah]?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4344" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they have made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4345" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they said, "If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not have worshipped them." They have of that no knowledge. They are not but falsifying.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4346" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Or have We given them a book before the Qur'an to which they are adhering?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4347" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Rather, they say, "Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are in their footsteps [rightly] guided."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4348" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, "Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4349" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>[Each warner] said, "Even if I brought you better guidance than that [religion] upon which you found your fathers?" They said, "Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4350" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So we took retribution from them; then see how was the end of the deniers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4351" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said to his father and his people, "Indeed, I am disassociated from that which you worship</value>

    <value>Except for He who created me; and indeed, He will guide me."</value>

    <value>And he made it a word remaining among his descendants that they might return [to it].</value>

  <data name="Quran4354" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, I gave enjoyment to these [people of Makkah] and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a clear Messenger.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4355" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But when the truth came to them, they said, "This is magic, and indeed we are, concerning it, disbelievers."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4356" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they said, "Why was this Qur'an not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran4357" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord?

  </data>
  <data name="Quran4358" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And if it were not that the people would become one community [of disbelievers], We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful - for their houses - ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount</value>

    <value>And for their houses - doors and couches [of silver] upon which to recline</value>

    <value>But when he brought them Our signs, at once they laughed at them.</value>

  <data name="Quran4373" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And We showed them not a sign except that it was greater than its sister, and We seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return [to faith].</value>

  <data name="Quran4374" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And they said [to Moses], "O magician, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. Indeed, we will be guided."</value>

    <value>But when We removed from them the affliction, at once they broke their word.</value>

    <value>And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, "O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers flowing beneath me; then do you not see?</value>

    <value>Or am I [not] better than this one who is insignificant and hardly makes himself clear?</value>

    <value>They said, "Thus has said your Lord; indeed, He is the Wise, the Knowing."</value>

    <value>On the [same] Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed, "Wait for us that we may acquire some of your light."

    <value>Then We sent following their footsteps Our messengers and followed [them] with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel.

    <value>Then indeed, they will [enter and] burn in Hellfire.</value>

    <value>They will be given to drink [pure] wine [which was] sealed.</value>

  <data name="Quran5874" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The last of it is musk. So for this let the competitors compete.</value>

  <data name="Quran5875" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And its mixture is of Tasneem,</value>

    <value>A spring from which those near [to Allah] drink.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Quran5877" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Indeed, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed.</value>

  <data name="Quran5878" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And when they passed by them, they would exchange derisive glances.</value>
