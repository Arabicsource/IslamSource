<div class="text ltr">Guide us to the straight <span class="del">path,</span> <span class="ins">path:</span></div>

<div class="info"> -11 +11 </div>
<div class="text ltr">those who believe in the revelation sent down to you and in what was sent before you, and firmly believe in the life to <span class="del">come;</span> <span class="ins">come --</span></div>

<div class="info"> -15 +15 </div>
<div class="text ltr">There are some who say, <span class="del">‘We</span> <span class="ins">"We</span> believe in God and the Last <span class="del">Day,’</span> <span class="ins">Day,"</span> yet they are not believers.</div>

<div class="info"> -18 +18 </div>
<div class="text ltr">When they are told, <span class="del">‘Do</span> <span class="ins">"Do</span> not cause corruption in the <span class="del">land,’</span> <span class="ins">land,"</span> they say, <span class="del">‘We</span> <span class="ins">"We</span> are only promoters of <span class="del">peace,’</span> <span class="ins">peace,"</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">And when they are told, <span class="del">‘Believe</span> <span class="ins">"Believe</span> as other people have <span class="del">believed,’</span> <span class="ins">believed,"</span> they say, <span class="del">‘Are</span> <span class="ins">"Are</span> we to believe just as fools <span class="del">believe?’</span> <span class="ins">believe?"</span> Surely they are the fools, even though they do not realize it.</div>

<div class="text ltr">When they meet those who believe, they say, <span class="del">‘We believe.’</span> <span class="ins">"We believe."</span> But when they are alone with their evil leaders, they say, <span class="del">‘We</span> <span class="ins">"We</span> are really with you; we were only <span class="del">mocking.’</span> <span class="ins">mocking."</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">They are like those who kindled a fire, and when it lighted up all around them, God took away their sight and left them in utter darkness, unable to <span class="del">see—</span> <span class="ins">see --</span></div>

<div class="info"> -32,3 +32,3 </div>
<div class="text ltr">Give the good news to those who believe and do good works, that they will have Gardens through which rivers flow: whenever they are given fruit to eat they will say, <span class="del">‘This</span> <span class="ins">"This</span> is what we were provided with <span class="del">before,’</span> <span class="ins">before,"</span> because they were given similar things. And there will be pure spouses for them, and they will abide there forever.</div>

<div class="text ltr">God does not disdain to give a parable about a gnat or a smaller creature. The faithful know that it is the truth from their Lord, but those who deny the truth ask, <span class="del">‘What</span> <span class="ins">"What</span> could God mean by this <span class="del">parable?’</span> <span class="ins">parable?"</span> He lets many go astray through it, and guides many by it. But He makes only the disobedient go astray:</div>

<div class="text ltr">those who break <span class="del">God’s</span> <span class="ins">God's</span> covenant after they have pledged to keep it, and sever whatever God has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the <span class="del">land—it</span> <span class="ins">land -- it</span> is they who are the losers.</div>

<div class="info"> -37,7 +37,7 </div>
<div class="text ltr">When your Lord said to the angels, <span class="del">‘I</span> <span class="ins">"I</span> am putting a successor on <span class="del">earth,’</span> <span class="ins">earth,"</span> they said, <span class="del">‘Will</span> <span class="ins">"Will</span> You place someone there who will cause corruption on it and shed blood, while we glorify You with Your praise and extol Your <span class="del">holiness?’</span> <span class="ins">holiness?"</span> [God] answered, <span class="del">‘Surely,</span> <span class="ins">"Surely,</span> I know that which you do not <span class="del">know.’</span> <span class="ins">know."</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">He taught Adam all the names, then He set them before the angels and said, <span class="del">‘Tell</span> <span class="ins">"Tell</span> Me the names of these, if what you say be <span class="del">true.’</span> <span class="ins">true."</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">They said, <span class="del">‘Glory</span> <span class="ins">"Glory</span> be to You; we have no knowledge except whatever You have taught us. You are the All Knowing, the All <span class="del">Wise.’</span> <span class="ins">Wise."</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">Then He said, <span class="del">‘O</span> <span class="ins">"O</span> Adam, tell them their <span class="del">names.’</span> <span class="ins">names."</span> When Adam had told them the names, God said to the angels, <span class="del">‘Did</span> <span class="ins">"Did</span> I not say to you: I know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you <span class="del">conceal?’</span> <span class="ins">conceal?"</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">When We said to the angels, <span class="del">‘Bow</span> <span class="ins">"Bow</span> down before <span class="del">Adam,’</span> <span class="ins">Adam,"</span> they all bowed except for Iblis [Satan]. He refused and acted proudly and became an unbeliever.</div>

<div class="text ltr">We said, <span class="del">‘O</span> <span class="ins">"O</span> Adam! live with your wife in Paradise and eat freely from it anywhere you may wish. Yet do not approach this tree lest you become <span class="del">wrongdoers.’</span> <span class="ins">wrongdoers."</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">But Satan caused them both to slip through this and thus brought about the loss of their former state. We said, <span class="del">‘Go</span> <span class="ins">"Go</span> down from here as enemies to each other; and on earth you shall have your abode and your livelihood for a <span class="del">while!’</span> <span class="ins">while!"</span></div>

<div class="info"> -45,2 +45,2 </div>
<div class="text ltr">We said, <span class="del">‘Go</span> <span class="ins">"Go</span> down, all of you, from here: then when guidance comes to you from Me, anyone who follows My guidance will have no fear, nor will they <span class="del">grieve—</span> <span class="ins">grieve --</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">those who deny and reject Our signs shall be the inhabitants of the Fire; therein shall they abide <span class="del">forever.’</span> <span class="ins">forever."</span></div>

<div class="info"> -56,2 +56,2 </div>
<div class="text ltr">Remember when We delivered you from <span class="del">Pharaoh’s</span> <span class="ins">Pharaoh's</span> people, who subjected you to grievous torment, slaying your sons and sparing only your <span class="del">daughters—surely</span> <span class="ins">daughters,  surely</span> in that there was a great trial for you from your <span class="del">Lord—</span> <span class="ins">Lord,</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">and when We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned <span class="del">Pharaoh’s</span> <span class="ins">Pharaoh's</span> people, while you looked on.</div>

<div class="info"> -61,2 +61,2 </div>
<div class="text ltr">When Moses said to his people, <span class="del">‘O</span> <span class="ins">"O</span> my people, you have indeed wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf; turn in repentance to your Creator and slay [the culprits] among you. That course is best for you in the sight of your <span class="del">Maker.’</span> <span class="ins">Maker."</span> He relented towards you. He is the Forgiving One, the Merciful.</div>

<div class="text ltr">Remember when you said, <span class="del">‘Moses,</span> <span class="ins">"Moses,</span> we will not believe in you until we see God with our own <span class="del">eyes,’</span> <span class="ins">eyes,"</span> a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on.</div>

<div class="info"> -64,2 +64,2 </div>
<div class="text ltr">Then We caused the clouds to provide shade for you and sent down for you manna and quails, saying, <span class="del">‘Eat</span> <span class="ins">"Eat</span> the good things We have provided for <span class="del">you.’</span> <span class="ins">you."</span> Indeed, they did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.</div>

<div class="text ltr">Remember when We said, <span class="del">‘Enter</span> <span class="ins">"Enter</span> this land and eat freely wherever you will. Make your way through the gates, bowing down and saying, <span class="del">“God!</span> <span class="ins">"God!</span> Forgive us our <span class="del">sins.”</span> <span class="ins">sins."</span> We shall forgive you your sins and We shall give abundance to those who do <span class="del">good.’</span> <span class="ins">good."</span></div>

<div class="info"> -67,6 +67,6 </div>
<div class="text ltr">When Moses prayed for water for his people, We said to him, <span class="del">‘Strike</span> <span class="ins">"Strike</span> the rock with your <span class="del">staff!’</span> <span class="ins">staff!"</span> And there gushed out from it twelve springs. Each tribe knew its drinking-place. [We said], <span class="del">‘Eat</span> <span class="ins">"Eat</span> and drink what God has provided and do not act wrongfully in the land, spreading <span class="del">corruption.’</span> <span class="ins">corruption."</span></div>

<div class="text ltr">When you said, <span class="del">‘Moses,</span> <span class="ins">"Moses,</span> we cannot bear to eat only one kind of food, so pray to your Lord to bring forth for us some of the <span class="del">earth’s</span> <span class="ins">earth's</span> produce, its herbs and cucumbers, its garlic, lentils, and <span class="del">onions.’</span> <span class="ins">onions."</span> Moses said, <span class="del">‘Would</span> <span class="ins">"Would</span> you take a lesser thing in exchange for what is better? Go to some town and there you will find all that you <span class="del">demand.’</span> <span class="ins">demand."</span> Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them, and they incurred the wrath of God, for having rejected His signs, and they killed His prophets unjustly, because they were rebels and transgressors.</div>
