<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">The Beneficent, the Merciful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Master of the Day of Judgment,</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Show us the straight path,</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Alif. Lam. Mim.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who ward off (evil).</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We have bestowed upon them;</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them; they believe not.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, when they believe not.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none save themselves; but they perceive not.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We are peacemakers only.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Are not they indeed the mischief-makers? But they perceive not.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say: shall we believe as the foolish believe? are not they indeed the foolish? But they know not.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but mock.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Allah (Himself) doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumacy.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when it sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, where they cannot see,</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps, for fear of death, Allah encompasseth the disbelievers (in His guidance, His omniscience and His omnipotence).</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them they stand still. If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their sight. Lo! Allah is able to do all things.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before you, so that ye may ward off (evil).</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy; and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know (better).</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your witness beside Allah if ye are truthful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves against the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) unto those who believe and do good works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us aforetime; and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure companions; there for ever they abide.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such a similitude? He misleadeth many thereby, and He guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants;</span></div>
