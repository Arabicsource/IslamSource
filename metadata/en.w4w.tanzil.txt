In (the) name|(of) Allah,|the Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful.
All praises and thanks|(be) to Allah,|the Lord|of the universe
The Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful.
(The) Master|(of the) Day|(of the) Judgment.
You Alone|we worship,|and You Alone|we ask for help.
Guide us|(to) the path,|the straight.
(The) path|(of) those|You have bestowed (Your) Favors|on them,|not (of)|those who earned (Your) wrath|on themselves|and not|(of) those who go astray.
Alif Laam Meem
That|(is) the book|no|doubt|in it,|a Guidance|for the God-conscious.
Those who|believe|in the unseen,|and establish|the prayer,|and out of what|We have provided them|they spend.
And those who|believe|in what|(is) sent down|to you|and what|was sent down|from|before you|and in the Hereafter|they|firmly believe.
Those|(are) on|Guidance|from|their Lord,|and those -|they|(are) the successful ones.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve[d],|(it) is same|to them|whether you warn them|or|not|you warn them,|not|they believe.
Has set a seal|Allah|on|their hearts|and on|their hearing,|and on|their vision|(is) a veil.|And for them|(is) a punishment|great.
And of|the people|(are some) who|say,|"We believed|in Allah|and in the Day|[the] Last,"|but not|they|(are) believers (at all).
They seek to deceive|Allah|and those who|believe[d],|and not|they deceive|except|themselves,|and not|they realize (it).
In|their hearts|(is) a disease,|so has increased them|Allah|(in) disease;|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful|because|they used to|[they] lie.
And when|it is said|to them,|"(Do) not|spread corruption|in|the earth,"|they say,|"Only|we|(are) reformers."
Beware,|indeed they|themselves|(are) the ones who spread corruption,|[and] but|not|they realize (it).
And when|it is said|to them,|"Believe|as|believed|the people,"|they say,|"Should we believe|as|believed|the fools?"|Beware,|certainly they|themselves|(are) the fools|[and] but|not|they know.
And when|they meet|those who|believe[d],|they say,|"We believe[d]."|But when|they are alone|with|their evil ones,|they say,|"Indeed, we|(are) with you,|only|we|(are) mockers."
Allah|mocks|at them,|and prolongs them|in|their transgression,|they wander blindly.
Those|(are) the ones who|bought|[the] astraying|for [the] guidance.|So not|profited|their commerce|and not|were they|guided-ones.
Their example|(is) like (the) example|(of) the one who|kindled|a fire,|then, when|it illuminated|what|(was) around him|took away|Allah|their light|and left them|in|darkness[es],|(so) not|(do) they see.
Deaf,|dumb,|blind,|so they|not|[they] will not return.
Or|like a rainstorm|from|the sky|in it (are)|darkness[es],|and thunder,|and lightning.|They put|their fingers|in|their ears|from|the thunderclaps|(in) fear (of)|[the] death.|And Allah|(is) [the One Who] encompasses|the disbelievers.
Almost|the lightning|snatches away|their sight.|Whenever|it flashes|for them|they walk|in it,|and when|it darkens|on them|they stand (still).|And if|had willed|Allah,|He would certainly have taken away|their hearing,|and their sight.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
O|mankind!|worship|your Lord,|the One Who|created you|and those|from|before you,|so that you may|become righteous.
The One Who|made|for you|the earth|a resting place|and the sky|a canopy,|and sent down|from|the sky|water,|then brought forth|therewith|[of]|the fruits|(as) provision|for you.|So (do) not|set up|to Allah|rivals|while you|[you] know.
And if|you are|in|doubt|about what|We have revealed|to|Our slave,|then produce|a chapter|[of]|like it|and call|your witnesses|from|other than|Allah|if|you are|truthful.
But if|not|you do,|and never|will you do,|then fear|the Fire|whose|[its] fuel|(is) [the] men|and [the] stones,|prepared|for the disbelievers.
And give good news|(to) those who|believe,|and do|[the] righteous deeds,|that|for them|(will be) Gardens,|flow|[from]|under them|the rivers.|Every time|they are provided|therefrom|of|fruit|(as) provision,|they (will) say,|"This (is)|the one which|we were provided|from|before."|And they will be given|therefrom|(things) in resemblance;|And for them|therein|spouses|purified,|and they|therein|(will) abide forever.
Indeed,|Allah|(is) not|ashamed|to|set forth|an example|(like) even|(of) a mosquito|and (even) something|above it.|Then as for|those who|believed,|[thus] they will know|that it|(is) the truth|from|their Lord.|And as for|those who|disbelieved|[thus] they will say|what|(did) intend|Allah|by this|example?|He lets go astray|by it|many|and He guides|by it|many.|And not|He lets go astray|by it|except|the defiantly disobedient.
Those who|break|(the) Covenant|(of) Allah|from|after|its ratification,|and [they] cut|what|has ordered|Allah|it|to|be joined|and [they] spread corruption|in|the earth.|Those,|they|(are) the losers.
How|(can) you disbelieve|in Allah?|While you were|dead|then He gave you life;|then|He will cause you to die,|then|He will give you life,|then|to Him|you will be returned.
He|(is) the One Who|created|for you|what|(is) in|the earth,|all.|Moreover|He turned|to|the heaven|and fashioned them|seven|heavens.|And He|of every|thing|(is) All-Knowing.
And when|said|your Lord|to the angels,|"Indeed, I (am)|going to place|in|the earth|a vicegerent,|they said,|"Will You place|in it|(one) who|will spread corruption|in it|and will shed|[the] blood[s],|while we,|[we] glorify (You)|with Your praises|and we sanctify|[to] You."|He said,|"Indeed, I|[I] know|what|not|you know."
And He taught|Adam|the names -|all of them.|Then|He displayed them|to|the angels,|then He said,|"Inform Me|of (the) names|(of) these,|if|you are|truthful."
They said,|"Glory be to You!|No|knowledge|(is) for us|except|what|You have taught us.|Indeed You!|You|(are) the All-Knowing,|the All-Wise.
He said,|"O Adam!|Inform them|of their names."|And when|he had informed them|of their names,|He said,|"Did not|I say|to you,|Indeed, I|[I] know|(the) unseen|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and I know|what|you reveal|and what|you [were]|conceal."
And when|We said|to the angels,|"Prostrate|to Adam,"|[so] they prostrated|except|Iblis.|He refused|and was arrogant|and became|of|the disbelievers.
And We said,|"O Adam!|Dwell|you|and your spouse|(in) Paradise,|and [you both] eat|from it|freely|(from) wherever|you [both] wish.|But do not|[you two] approach|this|[the] tree,|lest you [both] be|of|the wrongdoers."
Then made [both of] them slip|the Shaitaan|from it,|and he got [both of] them out|from what|they [both] were|in [it].|And We said,|"Go down (all of you),|some of you|to others|(as) enemy;|and for you|in|the earth|(is) a dwelling place|and a provision|for|a period."
Then received|Adam|from|his Lord|words,|So (his Lord) turned|towards him.|Indeed He!|He|(is) the Oft-returning (to mercy),|the Most Merciful.
We said,|"Go down|from it|all (of you),|and when,|comes to you|from Me|Guidance,|then whoever|follows|My Guidance,|[then] no|fear|(will be) on them|and not|they|will grieve.
And those|who disbelieve[d]|and deny|Our Signs,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire;|they|in it|(will) abide forever."
O Children|(of) Israel!|Remember|My Favor|which|I bestowed|upon you|and fulfill,|My Covenant|I will fulfill|your covenant|and Me Alone|fear [Me].
And believe|in what|I have sent down|confirming|that which|(is) with you,|and (do) not|be|(the) first|disbeliever|of it.|And (do) not|exchange|My Signs (for)|a price|small,|and Me Alone|fear [Me].
And (do) not|mix|the Truth|with [the] falsehood|and conceal|the Truth|while you|[you] know.
And establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and bow down|with|those who bow down.
Do you order|[the] people|[the] righteousness|and you forget|yourselves,|while you|[you] recite|the Book?|Then, will not|you use reason?
And seek help|through patience|and the prayer;|and indeed, it|(is) surely difficult|except|on|the humble ones,
Those who|believe|that they|will meet|their Lord|and that they|to Him|will return.
O Children|(of) Israel!|Remember|My Favor|which|I bestowed|upon you|and that I|[I] preferred you|over|the worlds.
And fear|a day,|(will) not|avail|any soul|for|(another) soul|anything,|and not|will be accepted|from it|any intercession,|and not|will be taken|from it|a compensation,|and not|they|will be helped.
And when|We saved you|from|(the) people|(of) Firaun|(who were) afflicting you (with)|horrible|torment,|slaughtering|your sons|and letting live|your women.|And in|that|(was) a trial|from|your Lord|great.
And when|We parted|for you|the sea,|then We saved you,|and We drowned|(the) people|(of) Firaun|while you|(were) looking.
And when|We appointed|(for) Musa|forty|nights.|Then|you took|the calf|from|after him|and you|(were) wrongdoers.
Then|We forgave|you|from|after|that,|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And when|We gave|Musa|the Book|and the Criterion,|perhaps you|(would be) guided.
And when|said|Musa|to his people,|"O my people!|Indeed, you|[you] have wronged|yourselves|by your taking|the calf.|So turn in repentance|to|your Creator,|and kill|yourselves.|That|(is) better|for you|with|your Creator."|Then He turned|towards you.|Indeed He!|He|(is) the-returning,|the Most Merciful.
And when|you said,|"O Musa!|Never|(will) we believe|in you|until|we see|Allah|manifestly."|So seized you|the thunderbolt|while you|(were) looking.
Then|We revived you|from|after|your death,|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And We shaded|[over] you|(with) [the] clouds|and We sent down|to you|[the] manna|and [the] quails,|"Eat|from|(the) good things|that|We have provided you."|And not|they wronged Us,|but|they were|(to) themselves|doing wrong.
And when|We said,|"Enter|this|town,|then eat|from|wherever|you wish[ed]|abundantly,|and enter|the gate|prostrating.|And say,|"Repentance."|We will forgive|for you|your sins.|And We will increase|the good-doers (in reward)."
But changed|those who|wronged|(the) word|other (than)|(that) which|was said|to them;|so We sent down|upon|those who|wronged,|a punishment|from|the sky|because|they were|defiantly disobeying.
And when|asked (for) water|Musa|for his people,|[so] We said,|"Strike|with your staff|the stone."|Then gushed forth|from it|(of)|twelve|springs.|Indeed|knew|all|(the) people|their drinking place.|"Eat|and drink|from|(the) provision (of)|Allah,|and (do) not|act wickedly|in|the earth|spreading corruption."
And when|you said,|"O Musa!|Never (will)|we endure|[on]|food|(of) one (kind),|so pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to bring forth|for us|out of what|grows|the earth,|of|its herbs,|[and] its cucumbers,|[and] its garlic,|[and] its lentils,|and its onions."|He said,|"Would you exchange|that which|[it]|(is) inferior|for that which|[it]|(is) better?|Go down|(to) a city,|so indeed|for you|(is) what|you have asked (for)."|And were struck|on them|the humiliation|and the misery|and they drew on themselves|wrath|of|Allah|That (was)|because they|used to|disbelieve|in (the) Signs|(of) Allah|and kill|the Prophets|without (any)|[the] right.|That|(was) because|they disobeyed|and they were|transgressing.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and those who|became Jews|and the Christians|and the Sabians -|who|believed|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last|and did|righteous deeds,|so for them|their reward|(is) with|their Lord|and no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
And when|We took|your covenant|and We raised|over you|the mount,|"Hold|what|We have given you|with strength,|and remember|what|(is) in it,|perhaps you|(would become) righteous."
Then|you turned away|from|after|that.|So if not|(for the) Grace|(of) Allah|upon you|and His Mercy,|surely you would have been|of|the losers.
And indeed,|you knew|those who|transgressed|among you|in|the (matter of) Sabbath.|So We said|to them,|"Be|apes,|despised."
So We made it|a deterrent punishment|for those|(in) front|(of) them|and those|after them|and an admonition|for those who fear (Allah).
And when|said|Musa|to his people,|"Indeed,|Allah|commands you|that|you slaughter|a cow."|They said,|"Do you take us|(in) ridicule."|He said,|"I seek refuge|in Allah|that|I be|among|the ignorant."
They said,|"Pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to make clear|to us|what|it (is)."|He said,|"Indeed, He|says,|"[Indeed] it|(is) a cow|not|old|and not|young,|middle aged|between|that,"|so do|what|you are commanded."
They said,|"Pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to make clear|to us|what|(is) its color."|He said,|"Indeed, He|says,|'[Indeed] it is|a cow|yellow,|bright|(in) its color,|pleasing|(to) those who see (it).'"
They said,|"Pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to make clear|to us|what|it (is).|Indeed,|[the] cows|look alike|to us.|And indeed we,|if|wills|Allah,|(will) surely be those who are guided."
He said,|"Indeed, He|says,|"[Indeed] it|(is) a cow|not|trained|to plough|the earth,|and not|water|the field;|sound,|no|blemish|in it."|They said,|"Now|you have come|with the truth."|So they slaughtered it,|and not|they were near|(to) doing (it).
And when|you killed|a man,|then you disputed|concerning it,|but Allah|(is) the One Who brought forth|what|you were|concealing.
So We said,|"Strike him|with a part of it."|Like this|revives|Allah|the dead,|and shows you|His Signs,|perhaps you may|use your intellect.
Then|hardened|your hearts|from|after|that|so they|(became) like [the] stones|or|stronger|(in) hardness.|And indeed,|from|the stones|certainly (there are some) which|gush forth|from it|[the] rivers,|and indeed,|from them|certainly (there are some) which|split,|so comes out|from it|[the] water,|and indeed,|from them|certainly (there are some) which|fall down|from|fear|(of) Allah.|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|you do.
Do you hope|that|they will believe|[for] you|while indeed|(there) has been|a party|of them,|(who used to) hear|(the) words|(of) Allah,|then|they distort it|from|after|[what]|they understood it,|while they|know?
And when|they meet|those who|believe[d],|they say,|"We have believed."|But when|meet in private|some of them|with|some (others),|they say,|"Do you tell them|what|has|Allah|to you|so that they argue with you|therewith|before|your Lord?|Then do (you) not|understand?"
Do not|they know|that|Allah|knows|what|they conceal|and what|they declare?
And among them|(are) unlettered ones,|(who) do not|know|the book|except|wishful thinking|and not|they|(do anything) except|guess.
So woe|to those who|write|the book|with their (own) hands|then,|they say,|"This|(is)|from|Allah,"|to barter|with it|(for) a price|little.|So woe|to them|for what|have written|their hands|and woe|to them|for what|they earn.
And they say,|"Never|will touch us|the Fire|except|(for) days|numbered."|Say,|"Have you taken|from|Allah|a covenant,|so never|will break|Allah|His Covenant?|Or|(do) you say|against|Allah|what|not|you know?"
Yes,|whoever|earned|evil|and surrounded him|with|his sins -|[so] those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire;|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And those who|believed|and did|righteous deeds,|those|(are the) companions|(of) Paradise;|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And when|We took|(the) covenant|(from the) Children|(of) Israel,|"Not|you will worship|except|Allah,|and with [the] parents|(be) good|and (with)|relatives|and [the] orphans|and the needy,|and speak|to [the] people|good,|and establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah."|Then|you turned away,|except|a few|of you,|and you (were)|refusing.
And when|We took|your covenant,|"Not|will you shed|your blood|and not|(will) evict|yourselves|from|your homes,"|then|you ratified|while you|(were) witnessing.
Then|you|(are) those|(who) kill|yourselves|and evict|a party|of you|from|their homes,|you support one another|against them|in sin|and [the] transgression.|And if|they come to you|(as) captives,|you ransom them,|while it|(was) forbidden|to you|their eviction.|So do you believe|in part (of)|the Book|and disbelieve|in part?|Then what|(should be the) recompense|(for the one) who|does|that|among you,|except|disgrace|in|the life|(of) the world;|and (on the) Day|of [the] Resurrection|they will be sent back|to|(the) most severe|punishment?|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|you do.
Those|(are) the ones who|bought|the life|(of) the world|for the Hereafter;|so not|will be lightened|for them|the punishment|and not|they|will be helped.
And indeed|We gave|Musa|the Book|and We followed up|from|after him|with [the] Messengers.|And We gave|Isa,|(the) son|(of) Maryam,|[the] clear signs|and We supported him|(with)|the Holy Spirit.|Is it (not) so (that) whenever|came to you|a Messenger|with what|(does) not|desire|yourselves,|you acted arrogantly?|So a party|you denied,|and a party|you kill(ed).
And they said,|"Our hearts|(are) wrapped."|Nay,|has cursed them|Allah|for their disbelief;|so little|(is) what|they believe.
And when|came to them|a Book|of|from|Allah|confirming|what (was)|with them,|though they used to|from|before|(that), pray for victory|over|those who|disbelieved -|then when|came to them|what|they recognized,|they disbelieved|in it.|So (the) curse|(of) Allah|(is) on|the disbelievers.
Evil (is) that|(for) which they have sold|with|themselves,|that|they disbelieve|in what|has revealed|Allah,|grudging|that|sends down|Allah|of|His Grace|on|whom|He wills|from|His servants.|So they have drawn (on themselves)|wrath|upon|wrath.|And for the disbelievers|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Believe|in what|has revealed|Allah,"|they say,|"We believe|in what|was revealed|to us."|And they disbelieve|in what|(is) besides it,|while it|(is) the truth|confirming|what|(is) with them.|Say,|"Then why|(did) you kill|(the) Prophets|(of) Allah|from|before,|if|you were|believers?"
And indeed|came to you|Musa|with [the] clear signs,|then|you took|the calf|from|after him|and you|(were) wrongdoers.
And when|We took|your covenant|and We raised|over you|the mount,|"Hold|what|We gave you,|with firmness|and listen."|They said,|"We heard|and we disobeyed."|And they were made to drink|in|their hearts|(love of) the calf|because of their disbelief.|Say,|"Evil (is) that|orders you (to do) it|with|your faith,|if|you are|believers."
Say,|"If -|is|for you|the home|(of) the Hereafter|with|Allah|exclusively,|from|excluding|the mankind,|then wish|(for) [the] death,|if|you are|truthful."
And never (will)|they wish for it,|ever,|because|(of what) sent ahead|their hands.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower|of the wrongdoers.
And surely you will find them|(the) most greedy|(of) [the] mankind|for|life,|and (greedier) than|those who|associate[d] partners (with Allah).|Loves|(each) one of them|if|he could be granted a life|(of) a thousand|year(s).|But not|it|(will) remove him|from|the punishment|that|he should be granted life.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of what|they do.
Say,|"Whoever|is|an enemy|to Jibreel -|then indeed he|brought it down|on|your heart|by (the) permission|(of) Allah|confirming|what|(was)|before it|and a guidance|and glad tiding(s)|for the believers."
Whoever|is|an enemy|(to) Allah|and His Angels,|and His Messengers,|and Jibreel,|and Meekael,|then indeed|Allah|(is) an enemy|to the disbelievers.
And indeed|We revealed|to you|Verses|clear,|and not|disbelieves|in them|except|the defiantly disobedient.
And is (it not that) whenever|they took|a covenant,|threw it away|a party|of them?|Nay,|most of them|(do) not|believe.
And when|came to them|a Messenger|(of)|from|Allah|confirming|what|(was) with them,|threw away|a party|of|those who|were given|the Book|(the) Book|(of) Allah|behind|their backs|as if they|(do) not|know.
And they followed|what|recite(d)|the devils|over|(the) kingdom|(of) Sulaiman.|And not|disbelieved|Sulaiman|[and] but|the devils|disbelieved,|they teach|the people|[the] magic|and what|was sent down|to|the two angels|in Babylon,|Harut|and Marut.|And not|they both teach|any|one|unless|they [both] say,|"Only|we|(are) a trial,|so (do) not|disbelieve."|But they learn|from those two|what|[they] causes separation|with it|between|the man|and his spouse.|And not|they (could)|at all [be those who] harm|with it|any|one|except|by permission|(of) Allah.|And they learn|what|harms them|and not|profits them.|And indeed|they knew|that whoever|buys it,|not|for him|in|the Hereafter|any|share.|And surely evil|(is) what|they sold|with it|themselves,|if|they were|(to) know.
And if|[that] they|(had) believed|and feared (Allah),|surely (the) reward|(of)|from|Allah|(would have been) better,|if|they were|(to) know.
O you|who|believe[d]!|"(Do) not|say|"Raina"|and say|"Unzurna"|and listen.|And for the disbelievers|(is) a punishment|painful.
(Do) not|like|those who|disbelieve|from|(the) People|(of) the Book|and not|those who associate partners (with Allah),|that|(there should) be sent down|to you|any|good|from|your Lord.|And Allah|chooses|for His Mercy|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is the) Possessor|(of) [the] Bounty|[the] Great.
What|We abrogate|(of)|a sign|or|[We] cause it to be forgotten,|We bring|better|than it|or|similar (to) it.|Do not|you know|that|Allah|over|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful?
Do not|you know|that,|Allah|for Him|(is the) Kingdom|(of) the heavens|and the earth?|And not|(is) for you|from|besides|Allah|any|protector|and not|any helper.
Or|(do) you wish|that|you ask|your Messenger|as|was asked|Musa|from|before?|And whoever|exchanges|[the] disbelief|with [the] faith,|so certainly|he went astray (from)|(the) evenness|(of) the way.
Wish[ed]|many|from|(the) People|(of) the Book|if|they could turn you back|from|after|your (having) faith|(to) disbelievers,|(out of) jealousy|from|(of)|themselves,|(even) from|after|[what]|became clear|to them,|the truth.|So forgive|and overlook|until|brings|Allah|His Command.|Indeed,|Allah|on|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful.
And establish|the prayer|and give|[the] zakah.|And whatever|you send forth|for yourselves|of|good (deeds),|you will find it|with|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And they said,|"Never|will enter|the Paradise|except|who|is|(a) Jew[s]|or|(a) Christian[s]."|That|(is) their wishful thinking.|Say,|"Bring|your proof|if|you are|[those who are] truthful."
Yes,|whoever|submits|his face|to Allah|and he|(is) a good-doer,|so for him|(is) his reward|with|his Lord.|And no|fear|(will be) on them|and not|they|(will) grieve.
And said|the Jews,|"Not|the Christians|(are) on|anything,"|and said|the Christians,|"Not|the Jews|(are) on|anything,"|although they|recite|the Book.|Like that|said|those who|(do) not|know,|similar|their saying.|[So] Allah|will judge|between them|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection|in what|they were|[in it]|differing.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (one) who|prevents|(the) masajid|(of) Allah|to|be mentioned|in them|His name,|and strives|for|their destruction?|Those!|Not|it is|for them|that|they enter them|except|(like) those in fear.|For them|in|the world|(is) disgrace|and for them|in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|great.
And for Allah|(is) the east|and the west,|so wherever|you turn|[so] there|(is the) face|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
And they said,|"has taken|Allah|a son."|Glory be to Him!|Nay,|for Him|(is) what|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|All|to Him|(are) humbly obedient.
(The) Originator|(of) the heavens|and the earth!|And when|He decrees|a matter,|[so] only|He says|to it|"Be,"|and it becomes.
And said|those who|(do) not|know,|"Why not|speaks to us|Allah|or|comes to us|a sign?"|Like that|said|those|from|before them|similar|their saying.|Became alike|their hearts.|Indeed,|We have made clear|the signs|for people|(who) firmly believe.
Indeed We!|[We] have sent you|with the truth,|(as) a bearer of good news|and (as) a warner.|And not|you will be asked|about|(the) companions|(of) the blazing Fire.
And never|will be pleased|with you|the Jews|and [not]|the Christians|until|you follow|their religion.|Say,|"Indeed,|(the) Guidance|(of) Allah,|it|(is) the Guidance."|And if|you follow|their desires|after|what|has come to you|of|the knowledge,|not|for you|from|Allah|any|protector|and not|any helper.
Those,|We have given them|the Book|recite it|(as it has the) right|(of) its recitation.|Those (people)|believe|in it.|And whoever|disbelieves|in it,|then those,|they|(are) the losers.
O Children|(of) Israel!|Remember|My Favor|which|I bestowed|upon you|and that I|[I] preferred you|over|the worlds.
And fear|a day|not|will avail|a soul|(of)|(another) soul|anything|and not|will be accepted|from it|any compensation,|and not|will benefit it|any intercession,|and not|they|will be helped.
And when|tried|Ibrahim|his Lord|with words|and he fulfilled them,|He said,|"Indeed I|(am) the One to make you|for the mankind|a leader."|He said,|"And from|my offspring?"|He said,|"(Does) not|reach|My Covenant|(to) the wrongdoers."
And when|We made|the House|a place of return|for mankind|and (a place of) security|and (said), "Take|[from]|(the) standing place|(of) Ibrahim,|(as) a place of prayer."|And We made a covenant|with|Ibrahim|and Ishmael|[that],|"[You both] purify|My House|for those who circumambulate|and those who seclude themselves for devotion and prayer|and those who bow down|and those who prostrate."
And when|said|Ibrahim,|"My Lord|make|this|a city|secure|and provide|its people|with|fruits,|(to) whoever|believed|from them|in Allah|and the Day|the Last,"|He said,|"And whoever|disbelieved,|[then] I will grant him enjoyment|a little;|then|I will force him|to|(the) punishment|(of) the Fire,|and evil|(is) the destination.
And when|(was) raising|Ibrahim|the foundations|of|the House|and Ishmael,|(saying), "Our Lord!|Accept|from us.|Indeed You!|[You] (are)|the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing.
Our Lord!|[and] Make us|both submissive|to You.|And from|our offspring|a community|submissive|to You.|And show us|our ways of worship|and turn|to us.|Indeed You!|[You] (are)|the Oft-returning,|the Most Merciful.
Our Lord!|[And] raise up|in them|a Messenger|from them|(who) will recite|to them|Your Verses|and will teach them|the Book|and the wisdom|and purify them.|Indeed You!|You (are)|the All-Mighty|the All-Wise."
And who|will turn away|from|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim|except|who|fooled|himself?|And indeed|We chose him|in|the world,|and indeed he,|in,|the Hereafter|surely (will be) among|the righteous.
When|said|to him|his Lord|"Submit (yourself),"|he said,|"I (have) submitted (myself)|to (the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
And enjoined|[it]|Ibrahim|(upon) his sons|and Yaqub,|"O my sons!|Indeed,|Allah|has chosen|for you|the religion,|so not|(should) you die|except|while you|(are) submissive."
Or|were you|witnesses|when|came to|Yaqub|[the] death,|when|he said|to his sons,|"What|will you worship|from|after me?"|They said,|"We will worship|your God|and (the) God|(of) your forefathers,|Ibrahim|and Ishmael|and Isaac -|God|One.|And we|to Him|(are) submissive."
This|(was) a community|(which)|has passed away,|for it|what|it earned|and for you|what|you have earned.|And not|you will be asked|about what|they used to|do.
And they said,|"Be|Jews|or|Christians,|(then) you will be guided."|Say,|"Nay,|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim,|(the) upright;|and not|he was|of|those who associated partners (with Allah)."
Say,|"We have believed|in Allah|and what|(is) revealed|to us|and what|was revealed|to|Ibrahim|and Ishmael|and Isaac|and Yaqub|and the descendants,|and what|was given|(to) Musa|and Isa|and what|was given|(to) the Prophets|from|their Lord.|Not|we make distinction|between|any|of them.|And we|to Him|(are) submissive."
So if|they believe[d]|in (the) like|(of) what|you have believed|in [it],|then indeed,|they are (rightly) guided.|But if|they turn away,|then only|they|(are) in|dissension.|So will suffice you against them|Allah,|and He|(is) the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing.
(The) color (religion)|(of) Allah!|And who|(is) better|than|Allah|at coloring?|And we|to Him|(are) worshippers.
Say,|"Do you argue with us|about|Allah|while He|(is) our Lord|and your Lord?|And for us|(are) our deeds|and for you|(are) your deeds|and we|to Him|(are) sincere.
Or|(do) you say|that|Ibrahim|and Ishmael|and Isaac|and Yaqub|and the descendants|were|Jews|or|Christians?"|Say,|"Are you|better knowing|or|(is) Allah?"|And who|(is) more unjust|than (the one) who|concealed|a testimony|(that) he has|from|Allah?|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|you do.
This|(was) a community|(which)|has passed away,|for it|what|it earned|and for you|what|you have earned.|And not|you will be asked|about what|they used to|do.
Will say|the foolish ones|from|the people,|"What|(has) turned them|from|their direction of prayer|which|they were used to|[on it]."|Say,|"For Allah|(is) the east|and the west.|He guides|whom|He wills|to|a path|straight."
And thus|We made you|a community|(of the) middle way|so that you will be|witnesses|over|the mankind,|and will be|the Messenger|on you|a witness.|And not|We made|the direction of prayer|which|you were used to|[on it]|except|that We make evident|(he) who|follows|the Messenger|from (he) who|turns back|on|his heels.|And indeed,|it was|certainly a great (test)|except|for|those whom|guided|(by) Allah.|And not|will|Allah|let go waste|your faith.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) to [the] mankind|Full of Kindness,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|We see|(the) turning|(of) your face|towards|the heaven.|So We will surely turn you|(to the) direction of prayer|you will be pleased with.|So turn|your face|towards the direction|(of) Al-Masjid|Al-Haraam|and wherever|that|you are|[so] turn|your faces|(in) its direction.|And indeed,|those who|were given|the Book|surely know|that it|(is) the truth|from|their Lord.|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|they do.
And even if|you come|(to) those who|were given|the Book|with all|(the) signs,|not|they would follow|your direction of prayer,|and not|(will) you (be)|a follower|(of) their direction of prayer.|And not|some of them|(are) followers|(of the) direction of prayer|(of each) other.|And if|you followed|their desires|from|after|[what]|came to you|of|the knowledge,|indeed, you|(would) then|(be) surely among|the wrongdoers.
(To) those whom|We gave [them]|the Book,|they recognize it|like|they recognize|their sons.|And indeed,|a group|of them|surely they conceal|the Truth|while they|know.
The Truth|(is) from|your Lord,|so (do) not|be|among|the doubters.
And for everyone|(is) a direction -|he|turns towards it,|so race|(to) the good.|Wherever|that|you will be|will bring|you|(by) Allah|together.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And from|wherever|you start forth,|[so] turn|your face|(in the) direction|(of) Al-Masjid|Al-Haraam.|And indeed, it|(is) surely the truth|from|your Lord.|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|you do.
And from|wherever|you start forth|[so] turn|your face|(in the) direction|(of) Al-Masjid|Al-Haraam.|And wherever|that|you (all) are|[so] turn|your faces|(in) its direction,|so that not|will be|for the people|against you|any argument|except|those who|wronged|among them;|so (do) not|fear them,|but fear Me.|And that I complete|My favor|upon you|[and] so that you may|(be) guided.
As|We sent|among you|a Messenger|from you|(who) recites|to you|Our verses|and purifies you|and teaches you|the Book|and the wisdom|and teaches you|what|not|you were|knowing.
So remember Me,|I will remember you|and be grateful|to Me|and (do) not|(be) ungrateful to Me.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Seek help|through patience|and the prayer.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) with|the patient ones.
And (do) not|say|for (the ones) who|are slain|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|"(They are) dead."|Nay,|(they are) alive|[and] but|you (do) not|perceive.
And surely We will test you|with something|of|[the] fear|and [the] hunger|and loss|of|[the] wealth|and [the] lives|and [the] fruits,|but give good news|(to) the patient ones.
Those who,|when|strikes them|a misfortune,|they say,|"Indeed, we|belong to Allah|and indeed we|towards Him|will return."
Those|on them|(are) blessings|from|their Lord|and Mercy.|And those|[they]|(are) the guided ones.
Indeed,|the Safa|and the Marwah|(are) from|(the) symbols|(of) Allah.|So whoever|performs Hajj|(of) the House|or|performs Umrah,|so no|blame|on him|that|he walks|between [both of] them.|And whoever|voluntarily does|good,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Appreciative,|All-Knowing.
Indeed,|those who|conceal|what|We revealed|of|the clear proofs,|and the Guidance,|from|after|[what]|We made clear|to the people|in|the Book -|those,|curses them|Allah|and curse them|the ones who curse.
Except|those|who repent[ed]|and reform[ed]|and openly declar[ed].|Then those,|I will accept repentance|from them,|and I (am)|the Acceptor of Repentance,|the Most Merciful.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve[d]|and die[d]|while they|(were) disbelievers,|those,|on them|(is the) curse|(of) Allah,|and the Angels,|and the mankind,|all together.
(Will) abide forever|in it.|Not|will be lightened|for them|the punishment|and not|they|will be reprieved.
And your God|(is) God|one (only);|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|the Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful.
Indeed,|in|(the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and alternation|of the night|and the day,|and the ships|which|sail|in|the sea|with what|benefits|[the] people,|and what|(has) sent down|Allah|from|the sky|[of]|water,|giving life|thereby|(to) the earth|after|its death,|and dispersing|therein|[of]|every|moving creature,|and directing|(of) the winds|and the clouds|[the] controlled|between|the sky|and the earth,|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who use their intellect.
And among|the mankind|who|takes|from|besides|Allah|equals.|They love them|as (they should) love|Allah.|And those who|believe[d]|(are) stronger|(in) love|for Allah.|And if|would see|those who|wronged,|when|they will see|the punishment|that|the power|(belongs) to Allah|all|and [that]|Allah|(is) severe|(in) [the] punishment.
When|will disown|those who|were followed|[from]|those who|followed|and they will see|the punishment,|[and] will be cut off|for them|the relations.
And said|those who|followed,|"(Only) if|[that]|for us|a return,|then we will disown|[from] them|as|they disown|[from] us."|Thus|will show them|Allah|their deeds|(as) regrets|for them.|And not|they|will come out|from|the Fire.
O|mankind!|Eat|of what|(is) in|the earth|lawful|(and) good.|And (do) not|follow|(the) footsteps (of)|the Shaitaan.|Indeed, he|(is) to you|an enemy|clear.
Only|he commands you|to (do) the evil|and the shameful|and that|you say|about|Allah|what|not|you know.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Follow|what|has revealed|Allah,"|they said,|"Nay|we follow|what|we found|[on it]|our forefathers (following)".|Even though|[were]|their forefathers|(did) not|understand|anything|and not|were they guided?
And (the) example|(of) those who|disbelieve[d]|(is) like (the) example|(of) the one who|shouts|at what|not|(does) hear|except|calls|and cries -|deaf|dumb,|(and) blind,|[so] they|(do) not|understand.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Eat|from|(the) good|(of) what|We have provided you|and be grateful|to Allah|if|you|alone|worship Him.
Only|He has forbidden|to you|the dead animals,|and [the] blood,|and flesh,|(of) swine,|and what|has been dedicated|[with it]|to other than|Allah.|So whoever|(is) forced by necessity|without|(being) disobedient|and not|transgressor,|then no|sin|on him.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|those who|conceal|what|(has) revealed|Allah (has)|of|the Book,|and they purchase|there with|a gain|little.|Those,|not|they eat|in|their bellies|except|the Fire.|And not|will speak to them|Allah|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Judgment|and not|will He purify them,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
Those|(are) they who|purchase[d]|[the] astraying|for [the] Guidance,|and [the] punishment|for [the] forgiveness.|So what (is)|their endurance|on|the Fire!
That|(is) because|Allah|revealed|the Book|with [the] Truth.|And indeed,|those|who differed|in|the Book|(are) surely in|schism|far.
It is not|[the] righteousness|that|you turn|your faces|towards|the east|and the west,|[and] but|the righteous[ness]|(is he) who|believes|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last,|and the Angels,|and the Book,|and the Prophets,|and gives|the wealth|in|spite of his love (for it)|(to) those|(of) the near relatives,|and the orphans,|and the needy,|and (of)|the wayfarer,|and those who ask,|and in|freeing the necks (slaves)|and (who) establish|the prayer,|and give|the zakah,|and those who fulfill|their covenant|when|they make it;|and those who are patient|in|[the] suffering|and [the] hardship,|and (the) time|(of) [the] stress.|Those|(are) the ones who|are true|and those,|[they]|(are) the righteous.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Prescribed|for you|(is) the legal retribution|in|(the matter of) the murdered,|the freeman|for the freeman,|and the slave|for the slave,|and the female|for the female.|But whoever|is pardoned|[for it]|from|his brother|anything,|then follows up|with suitable|[and] payment|to him|with kindness.|That (is)|a concession|from|your Lord|and mercy.|Then whoever|transgresses|after|that,|then for him|(is) a punishment|painful.
And for you|in|the legal retribution|(is) life,|O men|(of) understanding!|So that you may|(become) righteous.
Prescribed|for you|when|approaches|any of you|[the] death,|if|he leaves|good|(making) the will|for the parents|and the near relatives|with due fairness|a duty|on|the righteous ones.
Then whoever|changes it|after what|he (has) heard [it],|so only|its sin|(would be) on|those who|alter it.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
But whoever|fears|from|(the) testator|(any) error|or|sin,|then reconciles|between them,|then (there is) no|sin|on him.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Merciful.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Is prescribed|for you|[the] fasting|as|was prescribed|to|those|from|before you,|so that you may|(become) righteous.
(Fasting for) days|numbered.|So whoever|is|among you|sick|or|on|a journey,|then a prescribed number|of|days|other.|And on|those who|can afford it,|a ransom|(of) feeding|a poor.|And whoever|volunteers|good|then it|(is) better|for him.|And to|fast|(is) better|for you,|if|you|know.
Month|(of) Ramadhaan|(is) that|was revealed|therein|the Quran,|a Guidance|for mankind|and clear proofs|of|[the] Guidance|and the Criterion.|So whoever|witnesses|among you|the month,|then he should fast in it,|and whoever|is|sick|or|on|a journey|then prescribed number (should be made up)|from|days|other.|Intends|Allah|for you|[the] ease|and not|intends|for you|[the] hardship,|so that you complete|the prescribed period|and that you magnify|Allah|for|[what]|He guided you|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And when|ask you|My servants|about Me,|then indeed I am|near.|I respond|(to the) invocation|(of) the supplicant|when|he calls Me.|So let them respond|to Me|and let them believe|in Me,|so that they may|(be) led aright.
Permitted|for you|(in the) nights|(of) fasting|(is) the approach|to|your wives.|They|(are) garments|for you|and you|(are) garments|for them.|Knows|Allah|that you|used to|deceive|yourselves,|so He turned|towards you|and He forgave|[on] you.|So now|have relations with them|and seek|what|has ordained|Allah|for you.|And eat|and drink|until|becomes distinct|to you|the thread|[the] white|from|the thread|[the] black|of|[the] dawn.|Then|complete|the fast|till|the night.|And (do) not|have relations with them|while you|(are) secluded|in|the masajid.|These|(are the) limits|(set by) Allah,|so (do) not|approach them.|Thus|makes clear|Allah|His verses|for [the] people|so that they may|(become) righteous.
And (do) not|eat|your properties|among yourselves|wrongfully|and present|[with] it|to|the authorities|so that you may eat|a portion|from|(the) wealth|(of) the people|sinfully|while you|know.
They ask you|about|the new moons.|Say,|"They|(are) indicators of periods|for the people,|and (for) the Hajj."|And it is not|[the] righteousness|that|you come|(to) the houses|from|their backs,|[and] but|[the] righteous|(is one) who|fears (Allah).|And come|(to) the houses|from|their doors.|And fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) successful.
And fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|those who|fight you|and (do) not|transgress.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|like|the transgressors.
And kill them|wherever|you find them,|and drive them out|from|wherever|they drove you out,|and [the] oppression|(is) worse|than|[the] killing.|And (do) not|fight them|near|Al-Masjid|Al-Haraam|until|they fight you|in it.|Then if|they fight you,|then kill them.|Such|(is the) reward|(of) the disbelievers.
Then if|they cease,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And fight (against) them|until|not|(there) is|oppression,|and becomes|the religion|for Allah|Then if|they cease|then (let there be) no|hostility|except|against|the oppressors.
The month|[the] sacred|(is) for the month|[the] sacred,|and for all the violations|(is) legal retribution.|Then whoever|transgressed|upon you|then you transgress|on him|in (the) same manner|(as)|he transgressed|upon you.|And fear|Allah|and know|that|Allah|(is) with|those who fear (Him).
And spend|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and (do) not|throw (yourselves)|[with your hands]|into|[the] destruction.|And do good;|indeed,|Allah|loves|the good-doers.
And complete|the Hajj|and the Umrah|for Allah.|And if|you are held back|then (offer) whatever|(can be) obtained with ease|of|the sacrificial animal.|And (do) not|shave|your heads|until|reaches|the sacrificial animal|(to) its destination.|Then whoever|is|among you|ill|or|he (has)|an ailment|of|his head|then a ransom|of|fasting|or|charity|or|sacrifice.|Then when|you are secure|then whoever|took advantage|of the Umrah|followed|(by) the Hajj,|then (offer) whatever|(can be) obtained with ease|of|the sacrificial animal.|But whoever|(can) not|find -|then a fast|(of) three|days|during|the Hajj|and seven (days)|when|you return.|This|(is) ten (days)|in all.|That|(is) for (the one) whose,|not|is|his family|present|(near) Al-Masjid|Al-Haraam.|And fear|Allah|and know|that|Allah|(is) severe|(in) retribution.
(For) the Hajj|(are) months|well known,|then whoever|undertakes|therein|the Hajj|then no|sexual relations|and no|wickedness|and no|quarrelling|during|the Hajj.|And whatever|you do|of|good|knows it|Allah.|And take provision,|(but) indeed,|(the) best|provision|(is) righteousness.|And fear Me,|O men|(of) understanding!
Not is|on you|any sin|that|you seek|bounty|from|your Lord.|And when|you depart|from|(Mount) Arafat|then remember|Allah|near|the Monument|[the] Sacred.|And remember Him|as|He (has) guided you,|[and] though|you were|[from]|before [it],|surely among|those who went astray.
Then|depart|from|wherever|depart|the people|and ask forgiveness|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Then when|you complete[d]|your acts of worship|then remember|Allah|as you remember|your forefathers|or|(with) greater|remembrance.|And from|the people|who|say,|"Our Lord!|Grant us|in|the world."|And not|for him|in|the Hereafter|[of]|any share.
And from those|who|say,|"Our Lord!|Grant us|in|the world|good|and in|the Hereafter|good,|and save us|(from the) punishment|(of) the Fire."
Those -|for them|(is) a share|of what|they earned,|and Allah|(is) swift|(in taking) account.
And remember|Allah|during|days|numbered.|Then (he) who|hurries|in|two days|then no|sin|upon him,|and whoever|delays|then no|sin|upon him|for (the one) who|fears.|And fear|Allah|and know|that you|unto Him|will be gathered.
And of|the people|(is the one) who|pleases you|(with) his speech|in|the life|(of) the world,|and he calls to witness|Allah|on|what|(is) in|his heart,|and he|(is) the most quarrelsome|(of) opponents.
And when|he turns away|he strives|in|the earth|to spread corruption|[in it],|and destroys|the crops|and progeny.|And Allah|(does) not|love|[the] corruption.
And when|it is said|to him|"Fear|Allah,"|takes him|(his) pride|to [the] sins.|Then enough for him|(is) Hell -|[and] surely an evil|[the] resting-place.
And of|the people|(is the one) who|sells|his own self|seeking|pleasure|(of) Allah.|And Allah|(is) full of Kindness|to His servants.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Enter|in|Islam|completely,|and (do) not|follow|footsteps|(of) the Shaitaan.|Indeed, he|(is) for you|an enemy|open.
Then if|you slip|from|after|[what]|came to you|(from) the clear proofs,|then know|that|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Are|they waiting|[except]|that|comes to them|Allah|in|(the) shadows|of|[the] clouds,|and the Angels,|and is decreed|the matter?|And to|Allah|return|(all) the matters.
Ask|(the) Children|(of) Israel,|how many|We gave them|of|(the) Sign(s)|clear.|And whoever|changes|Favor|(of) Allah|from|after|[what]|it (has) come to him -|then indeed,|Allah|(is) severe|in [the] chastising.
Beautified|for those who|disbelieve[d]|(is) the life|(of) the world,|and they ridicule|[of]|those who|believe[d].|And those who|fear (Allah),|(they will be) above them|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection.|And Allah|provides|whom|He wills|without|measure.
Was|mankind|a community|single,|then raised up|Allah|[the] Prophets|(as) bearers of glad tidings|and (as) warners,|and sent down|with them|the Book|in [the] truth|to judge|between|[the] people|in what|they differed|[in it].|And (did) not|differ[ed]|in it|except|those who|were given it|from|after|[what]|came to them|the clear proofs,|(out of) jealousy|among themselves.|And guided|Allah|those who|believe[d]|regarding what|they differed|[in it]|of|the Truth|with His permission.|And Allah|guides|whom|He wills|to|a path|straight.
Or|(do) you think|that|you will enter|Paradise|while not|(has) come to you|like (came to)|those who|passed away|from|before you?|Touched them|[the] adversity|and [the] hardship,|and they were shaken|until|said|the Messenger|and those who|believed|with him,|"When|[will] (the) help|(of) Allah (come)|Unquestionably,|[Indeed]|help|(of) Allah|(is) near.
They ask you|what|they (should) spend.|Say,|"Whatever|you spend|of|good,|(is) for parents,|and the relatives,|and the orphans,|and the needy,|and (of)|the wayfarer.|And whatever|you do|of|good.|So indeed,|Allah|of it|(is) All-Aware.
Is prescribed|upon you|[the] fighting|while it|(is) hateful|to you.|But perhaps|[that]|you dislike|a thing|and it|(is) good|for you;|and perhaps|[that]|you love|a thing|and it|(is) bad|for you.|And Allah|knows|while you|(do) not|know.
They ask you|about|the month|[the] sacred -|(concerning) fighting|in it.|Say,|"Fighting|therein|(is) a great (sin);|but hindering (people)|from|(the) way|(of) Allah,|and disbelief|in Him|and (preventing access to) Al-Masjid|Al-Haraam,|and driving out|its people|from it,|(is) greater (sin)|near|Allah.|And [the] oppression|(is) greater|than|[the] killing."|And not|they will cease|(to) fight with you|until|they turn you away|from|your religion,|if|they are able.|And whoever|turns away|among you|from|his religion,|then dies|while he|(is) a disbeliever|for those|became worthless|their deeds|in|the world|and the Hereafter.|And those|(are) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and those who|emigrated|and strove|in|(the) way|(of) Allah -|those,|they hope|(for) Mercy|(of) Allah.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
They ask you|about|[the] intoxicants|and [the] games of chance|Say,|"In both of them|(is) a sin|great,|and (some) benefits|for [the] people.|But sin of both of them|(is) greater|than|(the) benefit of (the) two."|And they ask you|what|they (should) spend.|Say,|"The surplus."|Thus|makes clear|Allah|to you|[the] Verses|so that you may|ponder,
Concerning|the world|and the Hereafter.|They ask you|about|the orphans.|Say,|"Setting right (their affairs)|for them|(is) best.|And if|you associate with them|then they (are) your brothers.|And Allah|knows|the corrupter|from|the amender.|And if|(had) willed|Allah|surely He (could have) put you in difficulties.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise."
And (do) not|[you] marry|[the] polytheistic women|until|they believe.|And a bondwoman|(who is) believing|(is) better|than|a polytheistic woman|[and] even if|she pleases you.|And (do) not|give in marriage (your women)|(to) [the] polytheistic men|until|they believe,|and a bondman|(who is) believing|(is) better|than|a polytheistic man|[and] even if|he pleases you.|[Those]|they invite|to|the Fire,|and Allah|invites|to|Paradise|and [the] forgiveness|by His permission.|And He makes clear|His Verses|for the people|so that they may|take heed.
And they ask you|about|[the] menstruation.|Say,|"It|(is) a hurt,|so keep away (from)|[the] women|during|(their) [the] menstruation.|And (do) not|approach them|until|they are cleansed.|Then when|they are purified,|then come to them|from|where|has ordered you|Allah."|Indeed,|Allah|loves|those who turn in repentance|and loves|those who purify themselves.
Your wives|(are) a tilth|for you,|so come|(to) your tilth|when|you wish,|and send forth (good deeds)|for yourselves.|And be conscious|(of) Allah|and know|that you|(will) meet Him.|And give glad tidings|(to) the believers.
And (do) not|make|Allah's (name)|an excuse|in your oaths|that|you do good,|and be righteous|and make peace|between|[the] people.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Not|will take you to task|Allah|for (what is) unintentional|in|your oaths,|[and] but|He takes you to task|for what|(have) earned|your hearts.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Forbearing.
For those who|swear (off)|from|their wives|(is a) waiting (of)|four|months,|then if|they return -|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And if|they resolve|(on) [the] divorce -|then indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
And the women who are divorced|shall wait|concerning themselves|(for) three|monthly periods.|And (it is) not|lawful|for them|that|they conceal|what|(has been) created|(by) Allah|in|their wombs,|if|they|believe|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last.|And their husbands|(have) better right|to take them back|in|that (period)|if|they wish|(for) reconciliation.|And for them|(is the) like|(of) that which|(is) on them|in a reasonable manner,|and for the men|over them|(is) a degree.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
The divorce|(is) twice.|Then to retain|in a reasonable manner|or|to release (her)|with kindness.|And (it is) not|lawful|for you|that|you take (back)|whatever|you have given them|anything,|except|if|both fear|that not|they both (can) keep|(the) limits|(of) Allah.|But if|you fear|that not|they both (can) keep|(the) limits|(of) Allah|then (there is) no|sin|on both of them|in what|she ransoms|concerning it.|These|(are the) limits|(of) Allah,|so (do) not|transgress them.|And whoever|transgresses|(the) limits|(of) Allah|then those -|they|(are) the wrongdoers.
Then if|he divorces her,|then (she is) not|lawful|for him|from|after (that)|until|she marries|a spouse|other than him.|Then if|he divorces her|then no|sin|on them|if|they return to each other|if|they believe|that|they (will be able to) keep|(the) limits.|(of) Allah.|And these|(are the) limits.|(of) Allah.|He makes them clear|to a people|who know.
And when|you divorce|the women|and they reach|their (waiting) term,|then retain them|in a fair manner|or|release them|in a fair manner.|And (do) not|retain them|(to) hurt|so that you transgress.|And whoever|does|that,|then indeed,|he wronged|himself.|And (do) not|take|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|(in) jest,|and remember|(the) Favors|(of) Allah|upon you|and what|(is) revealed|to you|of|the Book|and [the] wisdom;|He instructs you|with it.|And fear|Allah|and know|that|Allah (is)|of every|thing|All-Knower.
And when|you divorce|[the] women|and they reached|their (waiting) term,|then (do) not|hinder them|[that]|(from) marrying|their husbands|when|they agree|between themselves|in a fair manner.|That|is admonished|with it|whoever|[is]|among you|believes|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last;|that|(is) more virtuous|for you|and more purer.|And Allah|knows|and you|(do) not|know.
And the mothers|shall suckle|their children|(for) two years|complete,|for whoever|wishes|to|complete|the suckling.|And upon|the father|(on) him|(is) their provision|and their clothing|in a fair manner.|Not|is burdened|any soul|except|its capacity.|Not|made to suffer|(the) mother|because of her child|and not|(the) father|(be)|because of his child.|And on|the (father's) heir|(is a duty) like|that (of the father).|Then if|they both desire|weaning|through|mutual consent|of both of them|and consultation,|then no|blame|on both of them.|And if|you want|to|ask another women to suckle|your child|then (there is) no|blame|on you,|when|you pay|what|you give|in a fair manner.|And fear|Allah|and know|that|Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And those who|pass away|among you|and leave behind|wives,|(the widows) should wait|for themselves|(for) four|months|and ten (days).|Then when|they reach|their (specified) term,|then (there is) no|blame|upon you|for what|they do|concerning|themselves|in a fair manner.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
And (there is) no|blame|upon you|in what|you hint|[with it]|of|marriage proposal|[to] the women|or|you conceal it|in|yourselves.|Knows|Allah|that you|will mention them,|[and] but|(do) not|promise them (widows)|secretly|except|that|you say|a saying|honorable.|And (do) not|resolve (on)|the knot|(of) marriage|until|reaches|the prescribed term|its end.|And know|that|Allah|knows|what|(is) within|yourselves|so beware of Him.|And know|that|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Forbearing.
(There is) no|blame|upon you|if|you divorce|[the] women|whom|not|you have touched|nor|you specified|for them|an obligation (dower).|And make provision for them -|upon|the wealthy|according to his means|and upon|the poor|according to his means -|a provision|in a fair manner,|a duty|upon|the good-doers.
And if|you divorce them|from|before|[that]|you (have) touched them|while already|you have specified|for them|an obligation (dower),|then (give) half|(of) what|you have specified,|unless|[that]|they (women) forgo (it)|or|forgoes|the one|in whose hands|(is the) knot|(of) the marriage.|And that|you forgo,|(is) nearer|to [the] righteousness.|And (do) not|forget|the graciousness|among you.|Indeed,|Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
Guard strictly|[on]|the prayers,|and the prayer -|[the] middle,|and stand up|for Allah|devoutly obedient.
And if|you fear|then (pray) on foot|or|riding.|Then when|you are secure|then remember|Allah|as|He (has) taught you|what|not|you were|knowing.
And those who|die|among you|and leave behind|(their) wives|(should make) a will|for their wives,|provision|for|the year|without|driving (them) out.|But if|they leave|then no|blame|upon you|in|what|they do|concerning|themselves|[of]|honorably.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
And for the divorced women,|(is) a provision|in a fair manner -|a duty|upon|the righteous.
Thus|makes clear|Allah|for you|His Verses|so that you may|use your intellect.
Did not|you see|[to]|those who|went out|from|their homes|and they|(were in) thousands|(in) fear|(of) [the] death?|Then said|to them|Allah,|"Die;"|then|He restored them to life.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) surely Possessor|(of) bounty|for|[the] mankind|[and] but|most|(of) the people|(are) not|grateful.
And fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|and know|that|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Who|(is) the one|who|will lend|(to) Allah -|a loan|good,|so (that) He multiplies it|for him -|manifolds|many|And Allah|withholds|and grants abundance,|and to Him|you will be returned.
Did not|you see|[towards]|the chiefs|of|(the) Children|(of) Israel|from|after|Musa,|when|they said|to a Prophet|of theirs,|"Appoint|for us|a king,|we may fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah?"|He said,|"Would|you perhaps -|if|prescribed|upon you|[the] fighting,|that not|you fight?"|They said,|"And what|for us|that not|we fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|while surely|we have been driven|from|our homes|and our children?"|Yet, when|was prescribed|upon them|the fighting|they turned away,|except|a few|among them.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of the wrongdoers.
And said|to them|their Prophet,|"Indeed,|Allah|(has) surely|raised|for you|Talut|(as) a king."|They said,|How|can be|for him|the kingship|over us,|while we|(are) more entitled|to kingship|than him,|and not|he has been given|abundance|of|[the] wealth?"|He said,|"Indeed,|Allah|has chosen him|over you|and increased him|abundantly|in|[the] knowledge|and [the] physique.|And Allah|gives|His kingdom|(to) whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing."
And said|to them|their Prophet,|"Indeed,|a sign|(of) his kingship|(is) that|will come to you|the ark,|in it|(is) tranquility|from|your Lord,|and a remnant|of what|(was) left|(by the) family|(of) Musa|and family|(of) Harun|will carry it|the Angels.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a sign|for you|if|you are|believers."
Then when|set out|Talut|with the forces|he said,|"Indeed,|Allah|will test you|with a river.|So whoever|drinks|from it|then he is not|from me,|and whoever|(does) not|taste it|then indeed, he|(is) from me|except|whoever|takes|(in the) hollow|(of) his hand."|Then they drank|from it|except|a few|of them.|Then when|he crossed it,|he|and those who|believed|with him,|they said,|"No|strength|for us|today|against Jalut|and his troops."|Said|those who|were certain|that they|(would) meet|Allah,|"How many|of|a company|small|overcame|a company|large|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And Allah|(is) with|the patient ones."
And when|they went forth|to (face) Jalut|and his troops|they said,|"Our Lord!|Pour|on us|patience|and make firm|our feet,|and help us|against|the people|(who are) disbelieving."
So they defeated them|by (the) permission|(of) Allah,|and killed|Dawood|Jalut,|and gave him|Allah|the kingdom|and the wisdom|and taught him|that which|He willed.|And if not|(for the) repelling|(by) Allah,|[the] people -|some of them|with others,|certainly (would have) corrupted|the Earth,|[and] but|Allah|(is) Possessor|(of) bounty|to|the worlds.
These|(are the) Verses|(of) Allah,|We recite them|to you|in [the] truth.|And indeed, you|(are) surely of|the Messengers.
These|(are) the Messengers|We (have) preferred|some of them|over|others.|Among them|(were those with) whom|spoke|Allah,|and He raised|some of them|(in) degrees.|And We gave|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|the clear proofs|and We supported him|with Spirit|[the] Holy.|And if|(had) willed|Allah|not|(would have) fought each other|those who|(came) from|after them,|from|after|[what]|came to them|the clear proofs.|[And] but|they differed,|[so] of them|(are some) who|believed|and of them|(are some) who|denied.|And if|(had) willed|Allah|not|they (would have) fought each other,|[and] but|Allah|does|what|He intends.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Spend|of what|We (have) provided you,|from|before|that|comes|a Day|no|bargaining|in it|and no|friendship|and no|intercession.|And the deniers -|they|(are) the wrongdoers.
Allah -|(there is) no|God|except|Him,|the Ever-Living,|the Sustainer of all that exists.|Not|overtakes Him|slumber|[and] not|sleep.|To Him (belongs)|what(ever)|(is) in|the heavens|and what(ever)|(is) in|the earth.|Who|(is) the one|who|can intercede|with Him|except|by His permission.|He knows|what|(is)|before them|and what|(is) behind them.|And not|they encompass|anything|of|His Knowledge|except|[of] what|He willed.|Extends|His Throne|(to) the heavens|and the earth.|And not|tires Him|(the) guarding of both of them.|And He|(is) the Most High,|the Most Great.
(There is) no|compulsion|in|the religion.|Surely|has become distinct|the right (path)|from|the wrong.|Then whoever|disbelieves|in false deities|and believes|in Allah,|then surely|he grasped|the handhold -|[the] firm,|(which) not|(will) break|[for it].|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Allah|(is the) Protecting Guardian|(of) those who|believe[d].|He brings them out|from|[the] darkness|towards|[the] light.|And those who|disbelieve(d)|their guardians|(are) the evil ones,|they bring them out|from|the light|towards|[the] darkness.|Those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|will abide forever.
Did not|you see|[towards]|the one who|argued|(with) Ibrahim|concerning|his Lord,|because|gave him|Allah|the kingdom?|When|Said|Ibrahim,|"My Lord|(is) the One Who|grants life|and causes death."|He said,|"I|give life|and cause death."|Said|Ibrahim,|"[Then] indeed|Allah|brings up|the sun|from|the east,|so you bring|it|from|the west."|So became dumbfounded|the one who|disbelieved,|and Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|(who are) [the] wrongdoers.
Or|like the one who|passed|by|a township,|and it|(had) overturned|on|its roofs.|He said,|"How|(will) bring to life|this (town)|Allah|after|its death?"|Then he was made to die|(by) Allah|(for) a hundred|year(s),|then|He raised him.|He said,|"How long|(have) you remained?"|He said,|"I remained|(for) a day|or|a part|(of) a day."|He said,|"Nay,|you (have) remained|one hundred|year(s).|Then look|at|your food|and your drink,|(they did) not|change with time,|and look|at|your donkey,|and We will make you|a sign|for the people.|And look|at|the bones|how|We raise them,|then|We cover them|(with) flesh."|Then when|became clear|to him,|he said,|"I know|that|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful."
And when|said|Ibrahim,|"My Lord|show me|how|You give life|(to) the dead."|He said,|"Have not|you believed?"|He said,|"Yes|[and] but|to satisfy|my heart."|He said|"Then take|four|of|the birds|and incline them|towards you,|then|put|on|each|hill|of them|a portion;|then|call them,|they will come to you|(in) haste.|And know|that|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Example|(of) those who|spend|their wealth|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|(is) like|a grain|which grows|seven|ears,|in|each|ear|hundred|grain(s).|And Allah|gives manifold|to whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
Those who|spend|their wealth|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|then|not|they follow|what|they spend|(with) reminders of generosity|and not|hurt -|for them|their reward|(is) with|their Lord,|and (there will be) no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
A word|kind|and (seeking) forgiveness|(are) better|than|a charity|followed [it]|(by) hurt.|And Allah|(is) All-Sufficient,|All-Forbearing.
O you|who|believe[d]!|(Do) not|render in vain|your charities|with reminders (of it)|or [the] hurt,|like the one who|spends|his wealth|(to) be seen|(by) the people,|and (does) not|believe|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last.|Then his example|(is) like|(that of a) smooth rock|upon it|(is) dust,|then fell on it|heavy rain,|then left it|bare.|Not|they have control|on|anything|of what|they (have) earned.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|[the] disbelieving.
And (the) example|(of) those who|spend|their wealth|seeking|(the) pleasure|(of) Allah,|and certainty|from|their (inner) souls,|(is) like|a garden|on a height,|fell on it|heavy rain|so it yielded|its harvest|double.|Then if|(does) not|fall (on) it|heavy rain,|then a drizzle.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
Would like|any of you|that|it be|for him|a garden,|of|date-palms|and grapevines|flowing|[from]|underneath it|the rivers,|for him|in it|of|all (kinds)|(of) [the] fruits,|and strikes him|[the] old age|and [for] his|children|(are) weak|then falls on it|whirlwind,|in it|(is) fire|then it is burnt.|Thus|makes clear|Allah|for you|(His) Signs|so that you may|ponder.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Spend|from|(the) good things|that|you have earned|and whatever|We brought forth|for you|from|the earth.|And (do) not|aim (at)|the bad|of it,|you spend,|while you (would) not|take it|except|[that]|(with) close(d) eyes|[in it],|and know|that|Allah|(is) Self-Sufficient,|Praiseworthy.
The Shaitaan|promises you|[the] poverty|and orders you|to immorality,|while Allah|promises you|forgiveness|from Him|and bounty.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
He grants|[the] wisdom|(to) whom|He wills,|and whoever|is granted|[the] wisdom,|then certainly|he is granted|good|abundant.|And none|remembers|except|those|(of) understanding.
And whatever|you spend|(out) of|(your) expenditures|or|you vow|of|vow(s),|then indeed,|Allah|knows it,|and not|for the wrongdoers|any|helpers.
If|you disclose|the charities|then good|it (is).|But if|you keep it secret|and give it|(to) the poor,|then it|(is) better|for you.|And He will remove|from you|[of]|your evil deeds.|And Allah|with what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
Not|on you|(is) their guidance|[and] but|Allah|guides|whom|He wills.|And whatever|you spend|of|good|then it is for yourself,|and not|you spend|except|seeking|(the) face|(of) Allah.|And whatever|you spend|of|good,|will be repaid in full|to you|and you|(will) not|be wronged.
For the poor,|those who|are wrapped up|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|not|they are able|(to) move about|in|the earth.|Think (about) them,|the ignorant one,|(that they are) self-sufficient|(because) of|(their) restraint,|you recognize them|by their mark.|Not|(do) they ask|the people|with importunity.|And whatever|you spend|of|good,|then indeed,|Allah|of it|(is) All-Knower.
Those who|spend|their wealth|by night|and day|secretly|and openly,|then for them|(is) their reward|with|their Lord,|and no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
Those who|consume|[the] usury|not|they can stand|except|like|stands|the one who,|confounds him|the Shaitaan|with|(his) touch.|That|(is) because they|say,|"Only|the trade|(is) like|[the] usury."|While has permitted|Allah|[the] trade|but (has) forbidden|[the] usury.|Then whoever -|comes to him|(the) admonition|from|His Lord|and he refrained,|then for him|what|(has) passed,|and his case|(is) with|Allah,|and whoever|repeated|then those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|will abide forever.
Destroys|Allah|the usury|and (gives) increase|(for) the charities.|And Allah|(does) not|love|every|ungrateful|sinner.
Indeed,|those who|believe[d]|and did|good deeds|and established|the prayer|and gave|the zakah|for them -|their reward|(is) with|their Lord,|and no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Fear|Allah|and give up|what|remained|of|[the] usury,|if|you are|believers.
And if|not|you do,|then be informed|of a war|from|Allah|and His Messenger.|And if|you repent|then for you|(is)|your capital -|(do) not|wrong|and not|you will be wronged.
And if|is|the (debtor)|in difficulty,|then postponement|until|ease.|And if|you remit as charity|(it is) better|for you.|If|you|know.
And fear|a Day|you will be brought back|[in it]|to|Allah.|Then|(will be) repaid in full|every|soul|what|it earned|and they|not|will be wronged.
O you|who|believe[d]!|When|you contract with one another|any debt|for|a term|fixed|then write it.|And let write|between you|a scribe|in justice.|And not|(should) refuse|a scribe|that|he writes|as|(has) taught him|Allah.|So let him write|and let dictate|the one|on whom|(is) the right|and let him fear|Allah,|his Lord,|and (let him) not|diminish|from it|anything.|Then if|is|the one|on him|(is) the right,|(of) limited understanding,|or|weak,|or|not|capable|that|(can) dictate|he,|then let dictate|his guardian|with justice.|And call for evidence|two witnesses|among|your men.|And if|not|there are|two men|then one man|and two women|of whom|you agree|of|[the] witnesses,|(so) that (if)|[she] errs,|one of the two,|then will remind|one of the two|the other.|And not|(should) refuse|the witnesses|when|that|they are called.|And not|(be) weary|that|you write it -|small|or|large|for|its term.|That|(is) more just|near|Allah,|and more upright|for evidence|and nearer|that not|you (have) doubt,|except|that|be|a transaction|present,|you carry out|among you,|then not|on you|any sin|that not|you write it.|And take witness|when|you make commercial transaction.|And not|(should) be harmed|(the) scribe|and not|(the) witness,|and if|you do,|then indeed it|(is) sinful conduct|for you,|and fear|Allah.|And teaches|Allah.|And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
And if|you are|on|a journey|and not|you find|a scribe,|then pledge|in hand.|Then if|entrusts|one of you|(to) another|then let discharge|the one who|is entrusted|his trust.|And let him fear|Allah,|his Lord.|And (do) not|conceal|the evidence.|And whoever|conceals it,|then indeed he|(is) sinful -|his heart.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Knower.
To Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And if|you disclose|what|(is) in|yourselves|or|you conceal it,|will call you to account|for it|Allah.|Then, He will forgive|[to] whom|He wills,|and He will punish|whom|He wills.|And Allah|on|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful.
Believed|the Messenger|in what|was revealed|to him|from|his Lord|and the believers.|All|believed|in Allah,|and His Angels,|and His Books,|and His Messengers.|"Not|we make distinction|between|any|of|His messengers."|And they said,|"We heard|and we obeyed.|(Grant) us Your forgiveness|our Lord,|and to You|(is) the return."
(Does) not|burden|Allah|any soul|except|its capacity,|for it|what|it earned,|and against it|what|it earned.|"Our Lord!|(Do) not|take us to task|if|we forget|or|we err.|Our Lord!|And (do) not|lay|upon us|a burden|like that|(which) You laid [it]|on|those who|(were) from|before us.|Our Lord!|[And] (do) not|lay on us|what|not|(the) strength|we have|[of it] (to bear).|And pardon|[from] us,|and forgive|[for] us|and have mercy on us.|You (are)|our Protector,|so help us|against|the people -|[the] disbelievers.
Alif Laam Meem
Allah -|(there is) no|God|except|Him,|the Ever-Living|the Sustainer of all that exists.
He revealed|to you|the Book|in [the] truth|confirming|that which|(was)|before it,|and He revealed|the Taurat|and the Injeel,
From|before (this),|(as) guidance|for the mankind.|And (He) revealed|the Criterion.|Verily,|those who|disbelieve[d]|in (the) Verses|(of) Allah,|for them|(is) a punishment|severe.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Able|(of) retribution.
Indeed|Allah -|not|is hidden|from Him|anything|in|the earth|and not|in|the heaven.
He|(is) the One Who|shapes you|in|the wombs|how(ever)|He wills.|(There is) no|god|except|Him,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
He|(is) the One Who|revealed|to you|the Book,|of it|(are) Verses|absolutely clear -|they (are)|the foundation|(of) the Book,|and others|(are) allegorical.|Then as for|those|in|their hearts|(is) perversity -|[so] they follow|what|(is) allegorical|of it,|seeking|[the] discord|and seeking|its interpretation.|And not|knows|its interpretation|except|Allah.|And those firm|in|[the] knowledge,|they say,|"We believe|in it.|All|(is)|from|our Lord."|And not|will take heed|except|men|(of) understanding.
"Our Lord!|(Do) not|deviate|our hearts|after|[when]|You (have) guided us,|and grant|(for) us|from|Yourself|mercy.|Indeed You,|You|(are) the Bestower.
Our Lord!|Indeed, You|will gather|[the] mankind|on a Day,|(there is) no|doubt|in it.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|break|the Promise."
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve[d]|never|will avail|[for] them|their wealth|and not|their children|against|Allah|anything,|and those -|they (are)|(the) fuel|(for) the Fire.
Like behavior|(of the) people|(of) Firaun|and those who|(were) from|before them.|They denied|Our Signs,|so seized them|Allah|for their sins.|And Allah|(is) severe|(in) [the] punishment.
Say|to those who|disbelieve[d],|"You will be overcome|and you will be gathered|to|Hell,|[and] an evil|[the] resting place.
Surely|it was|for you|a sign|in|(the) two hosts|which met -|one group|fighting|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and another|disbelievers.|They were seeing them|twice of them|with the sight|(of) their eyes.|And Allah|supports|with His help|whom|He wills.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (is) a lesson|for the owners|(of) vision.
Beautified|for mankind|(is) love|(of) the (things they) desire -|of|[the] women|and [the] sons|and [the] heaps|[the] stored up|of|[the] gold|and [the] silver,|and [the] horses|[the] branded,|and [the] cattle|and [the] tilled land.|That|(is) provision|(of) life|(of) the world|but Allah -|with Him|(is an) excellent|[the] abode to return.
Say,|"Shall I inform you|of better|than|that.|For those who|fear[ed],|with|their Lord,|(are) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|[the] rivers -|abiding forever|in it,|and spouses|pure|and approval|from|Allah.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of (His) slaves."
Those who|say,|"Our Lord!|Indeed, we|(have) believed,|so forgive|for us|our sins|and save us|(from) punishment|(of) the Fire."
The patient|and the truthful|and the obedient|and those who spend|and those who seek forgiveness|[in the] before dawn.
Bears witness|Allah|that [He],|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|and (so do) the Angels,|and owners|(of) [the] knowledge -|standing|in justice.|(There is) no|god|except|Him|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
Indeed,|the religion|near|Allah|(is) Islam.|And not|differed|those who|were given|the Book|except|from|after|[what]|came to them|[the] knowledge|out of envy|among them.|And whoever|disbelieves|in (the) Verses|(of) Allah,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) swift|(in taking) account.
Then if|they argue with you,|then say,|"I have submitted|myself|to Allah|and (those) who|follow me."|And say|to those who|were given|the Book,|and the unlettered people,|"Have you submitted yourselves?"|Then if|they submit|then surely|they are guided.|But if|they turn back|then only|on you|(is) to [the] convey.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of [His] slaves.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|in (the) Signs (of)|Allah|and they kill|the Prophets|without|right|and they kill|those who|order|[with] justice|among|the people,|then give them tidings|of a punishment|painful.
Those|(are) the ones who -|became worthless|their deeds|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter.|And not|(will be) for them|any|helpers.
Have not|you seen|[to]|those who|were given|a portion|of|the Scripture?|They are invited|to|(the) Book|(of) Allah|that (it should) arbitrate|between them,|then|turns away|a party|of them|and they (are)|those who are averse.
That|(is) because they|say,|"Never|will touch us|the Fire|except|(for) days|numbered."|And deceived them|in|their religion|what|they were|inventing.
Then how (will it be)|when|We will gather them|on a Day -|no|doubt|in it.|And will be paid in full|every|soul|what|it earned|and they|(will) not|be wronged.
Say|"O Allah!|Owner|(of) the Dominion,|You give|the dominion|(to) whom|You will|and You take away|the dominion|from whom|You will,|and You honor|whom|You will,|and You humiliate|whom|You will.|In Your hand|(is all) the good.|Indeed, You|(are) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
You cause to enter|the night|in|the day|and You cause to enter|the day|in|the night,|and You bring forth|the living|from|the dead,|and You bring forth|the dead|from|the living,|and You give provision|(to) whom|You will|without|measure."
(Let) not|take|the believers,|the disbelievers|(as) allies|from|instead of|the believers.|And whoever|does|that,|then not he (has)|from|Allah|in|anything|except|that|you fear|from them,|(as) a precaution.|And warns you|Allah|(of) Himself,|and to|Allah|(is) the final return.
Say,|"Whether|you conceal|what|(is) in|your breasts|or|you disclose it -|knows it|Allah.|And He knows|what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful."
(On the) day|will find|every|soul|what|it did|of|good -|presented,|and what|it did|of|evil,|it will wish|[if]|that|between itself|and between it (evil)|(was) a distance|great.|And warns you|Allah|(against) Himself,|and Allah|(is) Most Kind|to (His) [the] slaves.
Say,|"If|you|love|Allah,|then follow me,|will love you|Allah|and He will forgive|for you|your sins.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Say,|"Obey|Allah|and the Messenger."|Then if|they turn away -|then indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|the disbelievers.
Indeed,|Allah|chose|Adam|and Nuh,|and (the) family|(of) Ibrahim|and (the) family|(of) Imran|over|the worlds.
Descendents,|some of them|from|others.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
When|[she] said|(the) wife|(of) Imran,|"My Lord!|Indeed, I|[I] vowed|to You|what|(is) in|my womb,|dedicated,|so accept|from me.|Indeed, You,|You|(are) the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing.
Then when|she delivered her,|she said,|"My Lord,|indeed I|[I] (have) delivered [her]|a female."|And Allah|knows better|[of] what|she delivered,|and is not|the male|like the female.|"And that I|[I] (have) named her|Maryam|and that I|[I] seek refuge for her|in You|and her offspring|from|the Shaitaan|the rejected."
So accepted her,|her Lord|with acceptance|good,|and reared her -|a rearing|good,|and put her in (the) care|(of) Zakariya.|Whenever|entered|upon her|Zakariya|[the] prayer chamber|he found|with her|provision.|He said,|"O Maryam!|From where|for you|(is) this?"|She said,|"This|(is)|from|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|gives provision|(to) whom|He wills|without|measure."
There only,|invoked|Zakariya|his Lord,|he said,|"My Lord|grant|[for] me|from|Yourself|offspring|pure.|Indeed, You|(are) All-Hearer|(of) the prayer
Then called him|the Angels|when he|(was) standing -|praying|in|the prayer chamber.|"Indeed,|Allah|gives you glad tidings|of Yahya,|confirming|[of] a Word|from|Allah|and a noble|and chaste|and a Prophet|among|the righteous.
He said,|"My Lord|how|can (there) be|for me|a son,|and verily|has reached me|[the] old age|and my wife|(is) [a] barren?"|He said,|"Thus;|Allah|does|what|He wills."
He said,|"My Lord|make|for me|a sign."|He said,|your sign|(is) that not|you will speak|(to) the people|(for) three|days|except|(with) gestures.|And remember|your Lord|much,|and glorify (Him)|in the evening|and (in) the morning."
And when|said|the Angels,|"O Maryam!|Indeed,|Allah|(has) chosen you|and purified you|and chosen you|over|(the) women|(of) the worlds."
"O Maryam!|Be obedient|to your Lord|and prostrate|and bow down|with|those who bow down."
That|(is) from|(the) news|(of) the unseen -|We reveal it|to you.|And not|you were|with them|when|they cast|their pens|(as to) which of them|takes charge (of)|Maryam;|and not|you were|with them|when|they (were) disputing.
When|said|the Angels,|"O Maryam!|Indeed,|Allah|gives you glad tidings|of a word|from Him,|his name|(is) the Messiah,|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|honored|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter,|and of|those brought near (to Allah).
And he will speak|(to) the people|in|the cradle|and (in) maturity;|and (he will be) of|the righteous."
She said,|"My Lord|how|is [it]|for me|a boy,|and (has) not|touch(ed) me|any man?"|He said,|"Thus|Allah|creates|what|He wills.|When|He decrees|a matter|then only|He says|to it,|"Be,"|and it becomes.
And He will teach him|the Book,|and [the] wisdom,|and the Taurat,|and the Injeel.
And (make him) a Messenger|to|(the) Children|(of) Israel,|"Indeed, I|[surely]|[I] (have) come (to) you|with a sign|from|your Lord|that I|[I] design|for you|from|[the] clay|like the form|(of) the bird,|then I breath|into it|and it becomes|a bird|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And I cure|the blind,|and the leper,|and I give life|(to) the dead|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And I inform you|of what|you eat|and what|you store|in|your houses.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a sign|for you,|if|you are|believers.
And confirming|that which|(was)|before me|of|the Taurat,|and so that I make lawful|for you|some|(of) that which|was forbidden|to you.|And I (have) come to you|with a sign|from|your Lord.|So fear|Allah|and obey me.
Indeed,|Allah|(is) my Lord|and your Lord,|so worship Him.|This|(is) the path|straight."
Then when|perceived|Isa|from them|[the] disbelief|he said,|"Who|(will be) my helpers|to|Allah."|Said|the disciples|"We|(will be the) helpers|(of) Allah,|we believe[d]|in Allah|and bear witness|that we|(are) Muslims.
Our Lord,|we believe[d]|in what|You revealed|and we follow[ed]|the Messenger,|then write us|among|the witnesses."
And they schemed,|and planned|Allah.|And Allah|(is the) best|(of) the planners.
When|said|Allah|"O Isa!|Indeed, I|(will) take you|and raise you|to Myself|and purify you|from|those who|disbelieve[d],|and I will make|those who|follow[ed] you|superior|(to) those who|disbelieve[d]|on|(the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|Then|to Me|(is) your return|and I will judge|between you|about what|you were|[in it]|differing.
Then as for|those who|disbelieve[d],|then I will punish them|(with) a punishment|severe|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter.|And not|for them|any|helpers.
And as for|those who|believe[d]|and did|[the] righteous deeds|then He will grant them in full|their reward.|And Allah|(does) not|love|the wrongdoers.
That|(is what) We recite [it]|to you|of|the Verses|and the Reminder -|[the] Wise.
Indeed,|(the) likeness|(of) Isa|near|Allah|(is) like (the) likeness|(of) Adam.|He created him|from|dust|then|He said|to him,|"Be,"|and he was.
The truth|(is) from|your Lord,|so (do) not|be|among|the doubters.
Then whoever|argues (with) you|concerning it|from|after|what|came to you|of|the knowledge|then say,|"Come,|let us call|our sons|and your sons,|and our women|and your women,|and ourselves|and yourselves,|then|let us pray humbly,|and [we] invoke|the curse|(of) Allah|on|the liars.
Indeed|this,|surely it (is)|the narration -|[the] true.|And (there is) no|(of)|god|except|Allah.|And indeed,|Allah,|surely He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
And if|they turn back,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|of the corrupters.
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book!|Come|to|a word|equitable|between us|and between you -|that not|we worship|except|Allah,|and not|we associate partners|with Him -|anything|and not|take|some of us|(to) others|(as) lords|from|besides|Allah."|Then if|they turn away,|then say,|"Bear witness|that we|(are) Muslims."
O People|(of) the Book!|Why|(do) you argue|concerning|Ibrahim|while not|was revealed|the Taurat|and the Injeel|except|from|after him?|Then why don't|you use your intellect?
Here you are -|those who|argued|about what|[for] you|of it|(have some) knowledge.|Then why|(do) you argue|about what|not|for you|of it|(any) knowledge.|And Allah|knows,|while you|(do) not|know.
Not|was|Ibrahim|a Jew|and not|a Christian|[and] but|he was|a true|Muslim,|and not|he was|from|the polytheists.
Indeed,|the best to claim relationship|(of) people|with Ibrahim|(are) those who|follow him|and this|[the] Prophet|and those who|believe[d].|And Allah|(is) a Guardian|(of) the believers.
Wished|a group|from|(the) People|(of) the Book|if|they could lead you astray,|and not|they lead astray|except|themselves|and not|they perceive.
O People|(of) the Book!|Why do|you deny|[in] the Signs|(of) Allah|while you|bear witness?
O People|(of) the Book!|Why|do you mix|the truth|with the falsehood|and conceal|the truth|while you|know?
And said|a group|of|(the) People|(of) the Book,|"Believe|in what|was revealed|on|those who|believe[d]|(at the) beginning|(of) the day,|and reject|(at) its end,|perhaps they may|return.
And (do) not|believe|except|(the one) who|follows|your religion."|Say,|"Indeed|the (true) guidance|(is the) Guidance|(of) Allah -|lest|is given|(to) one -|(the) like|(of) what|was given to you|or|they may argue with you|near|your Lord."|Say,|"Indeed,|the Bounty|(is) in the Hand|(of) Allah.|He gives it|(to) whom|He wills,|and Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing."
He chooses|for His Mercy|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) the Possessor|(of) Bounty -|[the] great.
And from|(the) People|(of) the Book|(is he) who,|if|you entrust him|with a great amount of wealth|he will return it|to you.|And from them|(is he) who,|if|you entrust him|with a single coin|not|he will return it|to you|except|that|you keep constantly|over him|standing.|That|(is) because they|said,|"Not|on us|concerning|the unlettered people|any [way] (accountability)."|And they say|about|Allah|the lie|while they|know.
Nay,|whoever|fulfills|his covenant|and fears (Allah),|then indeed,|Allah|loves|those who fear (Him).
Indeed,|those who|exchange|(the) Covenant|(of) Allah|and their oaths|(for) a price|little,|those -|no|share|for them|in|the Hereafter|and not|will speak to them|Allah,|and not|look|at them|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|and not|purify them,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And indeed,|among them|surely (is) a group -|they distort|their tongues|in (reciting) the Book|so that you may think it|(is) from|the Book|and not|it|(is) from|the Book.|And they say,|"It|(is)|from|Allah."|But not|it|(is)|from|Allah.|And they say|about|Allah|the lie|while they|know.
Not|is|for a human|that|gives him|Allah|the Book,|and the wisdom,|and the Prophethood,|then|he says|to the people,|"Be|worshippers|of me|from|besides|Allah,|but (would say)|"Be|worshippers of the Lord|because|you have been|teaching|the Book|and because|you have been|studying (it)."
And not|he will order you|that|you take|the Angels,|and the Prophets|(as) lords.|Would he order you|to [the] disbelief|after|[when]|you (have become)|Muslims?
And when|took|Allah|covenant|(of) the Prophets,|"Certainly, whatever|I (have) given you|of|(the) Book|and wisdom|then|comes to you|a Messenger|confirming|that which|(is) with you,|you must believe|in him|and you must help him."|He said,|"Do you affirm|and take|on|that (condition)|My Covenant?"|They said,|"We affirm."|He said,|"Then bear witness,|and I (am)|with you|among|the witnesses."
Then whoever|turns away|after|that,|then those|they|(are) the defiantly disobedient.
So is (it) other than|(the) religion|(of) Allah|they seek?|While to Him|(have) submitted|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth,|willingly|or unwillingly,|and towards Him|they will be returned.
Say,|"We believed|in Allah|and what|(is) revealed|on us|and what|was revealed|on|Ibrahim,|and Ishmael,|and Isaac,|and Yaqub,|and the descendents|and what|was given|(to) Musa,|and Isa,|and the Prophets|from|their Lord.|Not|we make distinction|between|any|of them|and we|to Him|(are) submissive.
And whoever|seeks|other than|[the] Islam|(as) religion|then never|will be accepted|from him,|and he|in|the Hereafter,|(will be) from|the losers.
How|(shall) guide|Allah|a people|(who) disbelieved|after|their belief|and (had) witnessed|that|the Messenger|(is) true,|and came to them|the clear proofs?|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|[the] wrongdoers.
Those -|their recompense,|that|on them|(is the) curse|(of) Allah|and the Angels|and the people|all together.
(They will) abide forever|in it.|Not|will be lightened|for them|the punishment|and not|they|will be reprieved.
Except|those who|repent|from|after|that,|and reform[ed] themselves.|Then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|after|their belief|then|they increased|(in) disbelief|never|will be accepted|their repentance,|and those -|they|(are) those who have gone astray.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve[d]|and died|while they|(are) disbelievers,|then never|will be accepted|from|any one of them|full|earth|(of) gold|[and] (even) if|he offered as ransom|it.|Those -|for them|(is) a punishment|painful|and not|(will be) for them|any|helpers.
Never|will you attain|[the] righteousness|until|you spend|from what|you love.|And whatever|you spend|of|a thing|then indeed,|Allah|of it|(is) All-Knowing.
All|[the] food|was|lawful|for (the) Children|(of) Israel|except|what|made unlawful|Israel|upon|himself|from|before|[that]|(was) revealed|the Taurat.|Say,|"So bring|the Taurat|and recite it|if|you are|truthful."
Then whoever|fabricates|about|Allah|[the] lie|from|after|that,|then those -|they|(are) the wrongdoers.
Say,|(has) spoken the truth|Allah,|then follow|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim|(the) upright,|and not|he was|of|the polytheists.
Indeed,|(the) First|House|set up|for the mankind|(is) the one which|(is) at Bakkah,|blessed|and a guidance|for the worlds.
In it|(are) signs|clear,|standing place|(of) Ibrahim,|and whoever|enters it -|is|safe.|And (due) to Allah|upon|the mankind|(is) pilgrimage|(of) the House|(for one) who|is able|to [it]|(find) a way.|And whoever|disbelieved|then indeed,|Allah|(is) free from need|of|the universe.
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book!|Why|(do) you disbelieve|in (the) Verses|(of) Allah,|while Allah|(is) a Witness|over|what|you do?"
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book!|Why|(do) you hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah|(those) who|believe[d],|seeking (to make) it|(seem) crooked|while you|(are) witnesses?|And not|Allah|(is) unaware|of what|you do.
O you|who|believe[d]!|If|you obey|a group|from|those who|were given|the Book|they will turn you back|after|your belief|(as) disbelievers.
And how (could)|you disbelieve|while [you]|is recited|upon you|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|and among you|(is) His Messenger?|And whoever|holds firmly|to Allah,|then surely|he is guided|to|a path|straight.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Fear|Allah|(as is His) right|(that) He (should) be feared|and (do) not|die|except|[while you]|(as) Muslims.
And hold firmly|to (the) rope|(of) Allah|all together|and (do) not|be divided.|And remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|on you|when|you were|enemies|then He made friendship|between|your hearts|then you became|by His Favor|brothers.|And you were|on|(the) brink|(of) pit|of|the Fire|then He saved you|from it.|Thus|makes clear|Allah|for you|His Verses|so that you may|(be) guided.
And let there be|among you|[a] people|inviting|to|the good|[and] enjoining|the right,|and forbidding|from|the wrong,|and those -|they|(are) the successful ones.
And (do) not|be|like those who|became divided|and differed|from|after|what|came to them -|the clear proofs.|And those|for them|(is) a punishment|great.
(On the) Day|would become white|(some) faces|and would become black|(some) faces.|As for|those whose|turn black|[their] faces -|"Did you disbelieve|after|your belief?|Then taste|the punishment|for what|you used to|disbelieve."
But as for|those whose|turn white|[their] faces|then (they will be) in|(the) Mercy|(of) Allah,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
These|(are the) Verses|(of) Allah.|We recite them|to you|in truth.|And not|Allah|wants|injustice|to the worlds.
And to Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And to|Allah|will be returned|the matters.
You are|(the) best|(of) people|raised|for the mankind -|enjoining|the right|and forbidding|[from]|the wrong|and believing|in Allah.|And if|believed|(the) People|(of) the Book|surely would have been|good|for them.|Among them|(are) [the] believers,|but most of them|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Never|will they harm you|except|a hurt.|And if|they fight you,|they will turn (towards) you|the backs,|then|not|they will be helped.
Struck|on them|the humiliation|wherever|that|they are found|except|with a rope|from|Allah|and a rope|from|the people.|And they incurred|wrath|from|Allah|and struck|on them|the poverty.|That|(is) because|they used to|disbelieve|in (the) Verses|(of) Allah|and they killed|the Prophets|without|right.|That|(is) because|they disobeyed|and they used to|transgress.
They are not|(the) same;|among|(the) People|(of) the Book|(is) a community|standing|(and) reciting|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|(in the) hours|(of) the night|and they|prostrate.
They believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last|and they enjoin|[with] the right|and forbid|[from]|the wrong|and they hasten|in|the good deeds.|And those|(are) from|the righteous.
And whatever|they do|of|a good,|then never|will they be denied it.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of the God-fearing.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved,|never|will avail|[for] them|their wealth|and not|their children|against|Allah|anything,|and those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
Example|(of) what|they spend|in|this|[the] life|(of) the world|(is) like (the) example|(of) a wind|in it|(is) frost,|it struck|(the) harvest|(of) a people|who wronged|themselves,|then destroyed it.|And not|(has) wronged them|Allah|[and] but|themselves|they wronged.
O you|who|believe[d]!|(Do) not|take|(as) intimates|from|other than yourselves,|not|they will spare you|(any) ruin.|They wish|what|distresses you.|Indeed,|(has become) apparent|the hatred|from|their mouths,|and what|conceals|their breasts|(is) greater.|Certainly|We made clear|for you|the Verses,|if|you were|(to use) reason.
Lo! You are|those,|you love them|but not|they love you|and you believe|in the Book -|all of it.|And when|they meet you|they say,|"We believe."|And when|they are alone|they bite|at you|the finger tips|(out) of|[the] rage.|Say,|"Die|in your rage.|Indeed.|Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of what|(is in) the breasts."
If|touches you|a good,|it grieves them|and if|strikes you|misfortune,|they rejoice|at it.|And if|you are patient|and fear (Allah),|not|will harm you|their plot|(in) anything.|Indeed,|Allah,|of what|they do|(is) All-Encompassing.
And when|you left early morning|from|your household|to post|the believers|(to take) positions|for the battle.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
When|inclined|two parties|among you|that|they lost heart,|but Allah|(was) their protector.|And on|Allah|let put (their) trust|the believers.
And certainly|helped you|Allah|in Badr|while you (were)|weak.|So fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) grateful.
When|you said|to the believers,|"Is it not|enough for you|that|reinforces you|your Lord|with three|thousand[s]|[of]|[the] Angels|[the ones] sent down?
Yes,|if|you are patient|and fear (Allah)|and they come upon you|[of]|suddenly,|[this]|will reinforce you|your Lord|with five|thousand[s]|[of]|[the] Angels|[the ones] having marks.
And not|made it|Allah|except|(as) good news|for you|and to reassure|your hearts|with it.|And (there is) no|[the] victory|except|from|[near]|Allah,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
That He may cut off|a part|of|those who|disbelieved|or|suppress them|so (that) they turn back|disappointed.
Not|for you|of|the decision|(of) anything|whether|He turns|to them|or|punishes them|for indeed, they|(are) wrongdoers.
And to Allah (belongs)|what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth,|He forgives|[for] whom|He wills|and punishes|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you|who|believe!|(Do) not|eat|the usury|doubled|multiplied.|And fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) successful.
And fear|the Fire|which|is prepared|for the disbelievers.
And obey|Allah|and the Messenger|so that you may|receive mercy.
And hasten|to|forgiveness|from|your Lord|and a Garden -|its width|(is like that of) the heavens|and the earth|prepared|for the pious.
Those who|spend|in|[the] ease|and (in) the hardship|and those who restrain|the anger|and those who pardon|[from]|the people -|and Allah|loves|the good-doers.
And those|when|they did|immorality|or|wronged|themselves -|they remember|Allah|then ask forgiveness|for their sins -|and who|(can) forgive|the sins|except|Allah?|And not|they persist|on|what|they did|while they|know.
Those -|their reward|(is) forgiveness|from|their Lord|and Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers,|abiding forever|in it.|And an excellent|reward|(for) the (righteous) workers.
Verily|passed|from|before you|situations,|then travel|in|the earth|and see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the deniers.
This|(is) a declaration|for the people|and guidance|and admonition|for the God-fearing.
And (do) not|weaken|and (do) not|grieve|and you (will be)|[the] superior,|if|you are|believers.
If|touched you|a wound,|so certainly|(has) touched|the people|wound|like it.|And this|[the] days|We alternate them|among|the people|[and] so that makes evident|Allah|those who|believe[d]|and take|from you|martyrs.|And Allah|(does) not|love|the wrongdoers.
And so that may purify|Allah|those who|believe|and destroy|the disbelievers.
Or|do you think|that|you will enter|Paradise|while has not yet|made evident|Allah|those who|strove hard|among you|and made evident|the steadfast.
And certainly|you used to|wish|(for) death|from|before|[that]|you met it,|then indeed,|you have seen it|while you (were)|looking on.
And not|(is) Muhammad -|except|a Messenger,|certainly|passed away|from|before him|[the] (other) Messengers.|So if|he died|or|is slain|will you turn back|on|your heels?|And whoever|turns back|on|his heels|then never|will he harm|Allah|(in) anything.|And will reward|Allah|the grateful ones.
And not|is|for a soul|that|he dies|except|by (the) permission|(of) Allah,|(at a) decree|determined.|And whoever|desires|reward|(of) the world -|We will give him|thereof;|and whoever|desires|reward|(of) the Hereafter|We will give him|thereof.|And We will reward|the grateful ones.
And how many|from|a Prophet|fought;|with him|(were) religious scholars|many.|But not|they lost heart|for what|befell them|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and not|they weakened|and not|they gave in.|And Allah|loves|the patient ones.
And not|were|their words|except|that|they said,|"Our Lord|forgive|for us|our sins|and our excesses|in|our affairs|and make firm|our feet|and give us victory|over|[the people]|the disbelievers."
So gave them|Allah|reward|(in) the world|and good|reward|(in) the Hereafter.|And Allah|loves|the good-doers.
O you|who|believe!|If|you obey|those who|disbelieve,|they will turn you back|on|your heels,|then you will turn back|(as) losers.
Nay,|Allah|(is) your Protector|and He|(is the) best|(of) the Helpers.
We will cast|in|(the) hearts|(of) those who|disbelieve|[the] terror|because|they associated partners|with Allah,|what|not|He sent down|about it|any authority,|and their refuge|(will be) the Fire|and wretched|(is the) abode|[of] the wrongdoers.
And certainly|fulfilled to you|Allah|His promise,|when|you were killing them|by His permission,|until|when|you lost courage|and you fell into dispute|concerning|the order|and you disobeyed|from|after|[what]|He (had) shown you|what|you love.|Among you|(are some) who|desire|the world|and among you|(are some) who|desire|the Hereafter.|Then|He diverted you|from them|so that He may test you.|And surely|He forgave|you.|And Allah|(is the) Possessor|(of) Bounty|for|the believers.
When|you were running uphill|and not|casting a glance|on|anyone|while the Messenger|was calling you|[in]|(from) behind you.|So (He) repaid you|(with) distress|on distress|so that not|you grieve|over|what|escaped you|and not|what|(had) befallen you.|And Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
Then|He sent down|upon you|from|after|the distress|security -|slumber|overcoming|a group|of you,|while a group|certainly|worried [them]|(about) themselves|thinking|about Allah|other than|the truth -|(the) thought|(of) [the] ignorance.|saying,|"Is (there)|for us|from|the matter|any|thing?"|Say,|"Indeed|the matter|all (of) it|(is) for Allah."|They hide|in|themselves|what|not|they reveal|to you,|They say,|"If|was|for us|from|the matter|anything|not|we would have been killed|here."|Say,|"If|you were|in|your houses,|surely (would have) come out|those who -|was decreed|upon them|[the] death|towards|their places of death.|And that might test|Allah|what|(is) in|your breasts|and that He may purge|what|(is) in|your hearts.|And Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|(is in) the breasts.
Indeed,|those who|turned back|among you|(on the) day|met|the two hosts -|only|made them slip|the Shaitaan|for some|(of) what|they (had) earned.|And surely|forgave|Allah|[on] them,|indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Forbearing.
O you|who|believe[d]!|(Do) not|be|like those who|disbelieved|and they said|about their brothers|when|they traveled|in|the earth|or|they were|fighting,|"If|they had been|with us,|not|they (would have) died|and not|they (would have) been killed."|So makes|Allah|that|a regret|in|their hearts.|And Allah|gives life|and causes death,|and Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And if|you are killed|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|or|die[d] -|certainly forgiveness|from|Allah|and Mercy|(are) better|than what|they accumulate.
And if|you die|or|are killed,|surely to|Allah|you will be gathered.
So because|(of) Mercy|from|Allah|you dealt gently|with them.|And if|you had been|rude|(and) harsh|(at) [the] heart,|surely they (would have) dispersed|from|around you.|Then pardon|[from] them|and ask forgiveness|for them|and consult them|in|the matter.|Then when|you have decided,|then put trust|on|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the ones who put trust (in Him).
If|helps you|Allah,|then not|(can) overcome|[for] you,|and if|He forsakes you,|then who|(is)|the one who|can help you|from|after Him?|And on|Allah -|let put (their) trust.|the believers.
And not|is|for a Prophet|that|he defrauds.|And whoever|defrauds|will bring|what|he had defrauded|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection.|Then|is repaid in full|every|soul|what|it earned|and they|(will) not|be wronged.
So is (the one) who|pursues|(the) pleasure|(of) Allah|like (the one) who|draws|on (himself) wrath|of|Allah|and his abode|(is) hell,|and wretched|(is) the destination?
They|(are in varying) degrees|near|Allah,|and Allah|(is) All-Seer|of what|they do.
Certainly|bestowed a Favor|Allah|upon|the believers|as|He raised|among them|a Messenger|from|themselves|reciting|to them|His Verses|and purifying them,|and teaching them|the Book|and the wisdom,|although|they were|from|before (that)|certainly in|(the) error|clear.
Or when|struck you|disaster,|surely|you (had) struck (them)|twice of it,|you said,|"From where|(is) this?"|Say,|"It|(is)|from|yourselves."|Indeed,|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And what|struck you|(on the) day|(when) met|the two hosts|(was) by (the) permission|(of) Allah|and that He (might) make evident|the believers.
And that He (might) make evident|those who|(are) hypocrites.|And it was said|to them,|"Come,|fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|or|defend."|They said,|"If|we knew|fighting|certainly we (would have) followed you."|They -|to disbelief|that day|(were) nearer|than [them]|to the faith,|saying|with their mouths|what|was not|in|their hearts.|And Allah|(is) Most Knowing|of what|they conceal.
Those who|said|about their brothers|while they sat,|"If|they (had) obeyed us|not|they would have been killed."|Say,|"Then avert|from|yourselves|[the] death|if|you are|truthful.
And (do) not|think|(of) those who|are killed|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|(as) dead.|Nay!|They are alive,|near|their Lord;|they are given provision.
Rejoicing|in what|bestowed them|Allah|of|His Bounty,|and they receive good tidings|about those who|(have) not|yet joined|[with] them|[from]|(but are) left behind -|that (there will be) no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
They receive good tidings|of Favor|from|Allah|and Bounty|and that|Allah|(does) not|let go waste|(the) reward|(of) the believers.
Those who|responded|to Allah|and the Messenger|from|after|what|befell them -|the injury -|for those who|did good|among them|and feared Allah,|(is) a reward -|great.
Those who|said|to them|[the people],|"Indeed|the people|(have) certainly|gathered|against you,|so fear them."|But it increased them|(in) faith|and they said,|"Sufficient for us|(is) Allah|and (He is the) best|[the] Disposer of affairs."
So they returned|with (the) Favor|of|Allah|and Bounty,|not|touched them|any harm.|And they followed|(the) pleasure|(of) Allah,|and Allah|(is) Possessor|(of) Bounty|great.
(It is) only|that|the Shaitaan|frightens (you)|(of) his allies.|So (do) not|fear them,|but fear Me,|if|you are|believers.
And (let) not|grieve you|those who|hasten|in(to)|[the] disbelief.|Indeed, they|never|will harm|Allah|(in) anything.|intends|Allah|that not|He will set|for them|any portion|in|the Hereafter.|And for them|(is) a punishment|great.
Indeed,|those who|(have) purchased|[the] disbelief|with the faith|never|will they harm|Allah|(in) anything,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And (let) not|think|those who|disbelieved|that|We give respite|to them|(is) good|for themselves.|Only|We give respite|to them|so that they may increase|(in) sins,|and for them|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
Not|is|Allah|to leave|the believers|on|what|you (are)|in [it]|until|He separates|the evil|from|the good.|And not|is|Allah|to inform you|about|the unseen,|[and] but|Allah|chooses|from|His Messengers|whom|He wills,|so believe|in Allah|and His Messengers,|and if|you believe|and fear (Allah)|then for you|(is a) reward|great.
And (let) not|think|those who|withhold|of what|(has) given them|Allah|of|His Bounty|(that) it|(is) good|for them.|Nay,|it|(is) bad|for them.|Their necks will be encircled|(with) what|they withheld|[with it]|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|And for Allah|(is the) heritage|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|And Allah,|with what|you do,|(is) All-Aware.
Certainly,|heard|Allah|(the) saying|(of) those who|said,|"Indeed|Allah|(is) poor|while we|(are) rich."|We will record|what|they said|and their killing|the Prophets|without|(any) right,|and We will say,|"Taste|(the) punishment|(of) the Burning Fire."
That|(is) because|(of what) sent forth|your hands|and that|Allah|is not|unjust|to (His) slaves.
Those who|said,|"Indeed|Allah|(has) taken promise|from us|that not|we (should) believe|in a Messenger|until|he brings to us|a sacrifice -|consumes it|the fire."|Say,|"Surely|came to you|Messengers|from|before me|with the clear Signs|and with what|you speak.|So why|you killed them,|if|you are|truthful.
Then if|they reject you,|then certainly|were rejected|Messengers|from|before you|(who) came|with the clear Signs|and the Scriptures|and the Book -|[the] Enlightening.
Every|soul|(will) taste|[the] death,|and only|you will be paid in full|your reward|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|Then whoever|is drawn away|from|the Fire|and admitted|(to) Paradise|then surely|he is successful.|And not|(is) the life|(of) the world|except|enjoyment|(of) delusion.
You will certainly be tested|in|your wealth|and yourselves.|And you will certainly hear|from|those who|were given|the Book|from|before you|and from|those who|associate partners with Allah -|hurtful things|many,|and if|you are patient|and fear (Allah)|then indeed,|that|(is) of|the matters|(of) determination.
And when|took|Allah|a Covenant|(from) those who|were given|the Book,|"You certainly make it clear|to the mankind|and (do) not|conceal it.|Then they threw it|behind|their backs|and they exchanged|[with] it|(for) a price|little.|And wretched|(is) what|they purchase.
(Do) not|think|(that) those who|rejoice|in what|(they have) brought|and they love|that|they be praised|for what|not|they do -|so (do) not|think (that) they|(will) escape|from|the punishment;|and for them|(is a) punishment|painful.
And for Allah|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
Indeed,|in|(the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and (in the) alternation|(of) the night|and the day|(are) surely Signs|for men|(of) understanding.
Those who|remember|Allah|standing,|and sitting|and on|their sides|and they reflect|on|(the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|"Our Lord,|not|You have created|this|(in) vain.|Glory be to You,|so save us|(from the) punishment|(of) the Fire.
Our Lord,|indeed [You]|whom|You admit|(to) the Fire|then surely|You (have) disgraced him,|and not|for the wrongdoers|(are) any|helpers.
Our Lord,|indeed we|[we] heard|a caller|calling|to the faith|that|"Believe|in your Lord,"|so we have believed.|Our Lord|so forgive|for us|our sins|and remove|from us|our evil deeds,|and cause us to die|with|the righteous.
Our Lord,|grant us|what|You promised us|through|Your Messengers|and (do) not|disgrace us|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|Indeed, You|(do) not|break|the promise."
Then responded|to them|their Lord,|"Indeed, I|(will) not|(let go) waste|deeds|(of the) doer|among you|[from]|(whether) male|or|female|each of you|from|(the) other.|So those who|emigrated|and were driven out|from|their homes,|and were harmed|in|My way|and fought|and were killed -|surely I (will) remove|from them|their evil deeds|and surely I will admit them|(to) Gardens|flowing|from|underneath them|the rivers -|a reward|from|[near]|Allah.|And Allah -|with Him|(is the) best|reward."
(Let) not|deceive you|(the) movement|(of) those who|disbelieved|in|the land.
An enjoyment|little,|then|their abode|(is) hell -|[and] a wretched|[the] resting place.
But|those who|fear|their Lord,|for them|(will be) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers,|will abide forever|in it -|a hospitality|from|[near]|Allah.|And what|(is) with|Allah|(is) best|for the righteous.
And indeed,|among|(the) People|(of) the Book|(are those) who|believe|in Allah|and what|was revealed|to you|and what|was revealed|to them -|humbly submissive|to Allah.|Not|(do) they exchange|[with] (the) Verses|(of) Allah|(for) a price|little.|Those,|for them,|their reward|(is) with|their Lord.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) swift|(in taking) the account.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Be steadfast|and [be] patient|and [be] constant|and fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) successful.
O|mankind!|Fear|your Lord|the One Who|created you|from|a soul|single|and created|from it|its mate|and dispersed|from both of them|men|many|and women.|And fear|Allah|(through) Whom|you ask|[with it]|and the wombs.|Indeed,|Allah|is|over you|Ever-Watchful.
And give|(to) the orphans|their wealth,|and (do) not|exchange|the bad|with the good,|and (do) not|consume|their wealth|with|your wealth.|Indeed, it|is|a sin|great.
And if|you fear|that not|you will be able to do justice|with|the orphans,|then marry|what|seems suitable|to you|from|the women|two,|or three,|or four.|But if|you fear|that not|you can do justice|then (marry) one|or|what|possesses|your right hand.|That|(is) more appropriate|that (may) not|you oppress.
And give|the women|their dower|graciously.|But if|they remit|to you|of|anything|of it|(on their) own,|then eat it|(in) satisfaction|(and) ease.
And (do) not|give|the foolish|your wealth|which|(was) made|(by) Allah|for you|a means of support|(but) provide (for) them|with it|and clothe them|and speak|to them|words|(of) kindness.
And test|the orphans|until|[when]|they reach[ed]|(the age of) marriage,|then if|you perceive|in them|sound judgement|then deliver|to them|their wealth.|And (do) not|eat it|extravagantly|and hastily|(fearing) that|they will grow up.|And whoever|is|rich|then he should refrain,|and whoever|is|poor|then let him eat (of it)|in a fair manner.|Then when|you deliver|to them|their wealth|then take witnesses|on them.|And is sufficient|Allah|(as) a Reckoner.
For the men|a portion|of what|(is) left|(by) the parents,|and the near relatives|and for the women|a portion|of what|(is) left|(by) parents|and the near relatives|of what|(is) little|of it|or|much -|a portion|obligatory.
And when|present|(at) the (time of) division|(of)|the relatives|and the orphans|and the poor,|then provide them|from it|and speak|to them|words|(of) kindness.
And let fear -|those who,|if|they left|from|behind|offspring|weak|(and) they would have feared|about them.|So let them fear|Allah|and let them speak|words|appropriate.
Indeed,|those who|consume|wealth|(of) the orphans|wrongfully,|only|they consume|in|their bellies|fire,|and they will be burned|(in) a Blazing Fire.
Instructs you|Allah|concerning|your children -|for the male|like|(the) portion|(of) two females.|But if|there are|(only) women|more (than)|two,|then for them|two thirds|(of) what|he left.|And if|(there) is|(only) one,|then for her|(is) half.|And for his parents,|for each|one|of them|a sixth|of what|(is) left,|if|is|for him|a child.|But if|not|is|for him|any child|and inherit[ed] him|his parents,|then for his mother|(is) one third.|And if|are|for him|brothers and sisters,|then for his mother|(is) the sixth|from|after|any will|he has made|[of which]|or|any debt.|Your parents|and your children -|not|you know|which of them|(is) nearer|to you|(in) benefit.|An obligation|from|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And for you|(is) half|(of) what|(is) left|by your wives|if|not|is|for them|a child.|But if|is|for them|a child,|then for you|(is) the fourth|of what|they left,|from|after|any will|they have made|[for which]|or|any debt.|And for them|(is) the fourth|of what|you left,|if|not|is|for you|a child.|But if|is|for you|a child,|then for them|(is) the eighth|of what|you left|from|after|any will|you have made|[for which]|or|any debt.|And if|[is]|a man|(whose wealth) is to be inherited|(has) no parent or child|or|a women|and for him|(is) a brother|or|a sister,|then for each|one|of (the) two|(is) the sixth.|But if|they are|more|than|that,|then they|(are) partners|in|the third,|from|after|any will|was made|[for which]|or|any debt|without|(being) harmful.|An ordinance|from|Allah.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|All-Forbearing.
These|(are the) limits|(of) Allah,|and whoever|obeys|Allah|and His Messenger,|He will admit him|(to) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers -|(will) abide forever|in it.|And that|(is) the success|[the] great.
And whoever|disobeys|Allah|and His Messenger|and transgresses|His limits -|He will admit him|(to) Fire|(will) abide forever|in it.|And for him|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|commit|[the] immorality|from|your women|then call to witness|against them|four|among you.|And if|they testify|then confine them|in|their houses|until|comes to them|[the] death|or|makes|Allah|for them|a way.
And the two who|commit it|among you,|then punish both of them.|But if|they repent|and correct themselves,|then turn away|from both of them.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most-Merciful.
Only|the acceptance of repentance|by|Allah|(is) for those who|do|the evil|in ignorance,|then|they repent|from|soon after.|Then those|will have forgiveness|(from) Allah|upon them,|and is|Allah|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And not|(is) the acceptance of repentance|for those who|do|the evil deeds|until|when|approaches|one of them|[the] death,|he says,|"Indeed I|repent|now;"|and not|those who|die|while they|(are) disbelievers.|Those -|We have prepared|for them|a punishment|painful.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Not|(is) lawful|for you|that|you inherit|the women|(by) force.|And not|you constraint them|so that you may take|a part|(of) what|you have given them|except|that|they commit|immorality|open.|And live with them|in kindness.|But if|you dislike them,|then perhaps|that|you dislike|a thing|and has placed|Allah|in it|good|much.
And if|you intend|replacing|a wife|(in) place|(of) a wife|and you have given|one of them|heap (of gold)|then (do) not|take away|from it|anything.|Would you take it|(by) slander|and a sin|open?
And how|could you take it|when surely|has gone -|one of you|to|another,|and they have taken|from you|covenant|strong?
And (do) not|marry|whom|married|your fathers|of|the women|except|what|has|passed before,|indeed it|was|an immorality|and hateful,|and (an) evil|way.
Forbidden|to you|(are) your mothers|and your daughters|and your sisters|and your father's sisters|and your mother's sisters|and daughters|(of) brothers,|and daughters|(of) sisters|and (the) mothers|who|nursed you|and your sisters|from|the nursing|and mothers|(of) your wives|and your step daughters|who|(are) in|your guardianship|of|your women|whom|you had relations|with them,|but if|not|you had|relations|with them,|then (there is) no|sin|on you.|And wives|(of) your sons,|those who|(are) from|your loins|and that|you gather together|[between]|two sisters|except|what|has|passed before.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most-Merciful.
And (prohibited are) the ones who are married|of|the women|except|whom|you possess|rightfully.|Decree|(of) Allah|upon you.|And are lawful|to you|what|(is) beyond|that;|that|you seek|with your wealth|desiring to be chaste|not|(to be) lustful.|So what|you benefit[ed]|of it|from them,|so you give them|their bridal due|(as) an obligation.|And (there is) no|sin|on you|concerning what|you mutually agree|of it|from|beyond|the obligation.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And whoever|(is) not|able to|among you|afford|to|marry|the free chaste|[the] believing women|then (marry) from|what|possess[ed]|your right hands|of|your slave girls -|(of) the believers.|And Allah|knows best|about your faith.|You|(are) from|(one) another.|So marry them|with (the) permission|(of) their family|and give them|their bridal due|in a fair manner.|(They should be) chaste|not|those who commit immorality|and not|those who take|secret lovers.|Then when|they are married|and if|they commit|adultery|then for them|(is) half|(of) what|(is) on|the free chaste women|of|the punishment.|That|(is) for whoever|fears|committing sin|among you|and that|you be patient|(is) better|for you.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Wishes|Allah|to make clear|to you|and to guide you|(to) ways|(of) those|from|before you|and (to) accept repentance|from you.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And Allah|wishes|to|accept repentance|from you,|but wish|those who|follow|the passions|that|you deviate -|(into) a deviation|great.
Wishes|Allah|to|lighten|for you;|and was created|the mankind|weak.
O you|who|believe[d]!|(Do) not|eat|your wealth|between yourselves|unjustly.|But|that|(there) be|business|on|mutual consent|among you.|And (do) not|kill|yourselves.|Indeed,|Allah|is|to you|Most Merciful.
And whoever|does|that|(in) aggression|and injustice,|then soon|We (will) cast him|(into) a Fire.|And is|that|for|Allah|easy.
If|you avoid|great (sins)|(of) what|you are forbidden|from [it],|We will remove|from you|your evil deeds|and We will admit you|(to) an entrance|noble.
And (do) not|covet|what|(has) bestowed|Allah|[with it]|some of you|over|others.|For men|(is) a share|of what|they earned,|and for women|(is) a share|of what|they earned.|And ask|Allah|of|His bounty.|Indeed,|Allah|is|of every|thing|All-Knower.
And for all|We (have) made|heirs|of what|(is) left|(by) the parents|and the relatives.|And those whom|pledged|your right hands -|then give them|their share.|Indeed,|Allah|is|over|every|thing|a Witness.
[The] men|(are) protectors|of|the women|because|(has) bestowed|Allah|some of them|over|others|and because|they spend|from|their wealth.|So the righteous women|(are) obedient,|guarding|in the unseen|that which|(orders) them to guard|(by) Allah.|And those (from) whom|you fear|their ill-conduct|then advise them,|and forsake them|in|the bed|and [finally] strike them.|Then if|they obey you|then (do) not|seek|against them|a way.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Most High,|Most Great.
And if|you fear|a dissension|between (the) two of them,|then send|an arbitrator|from|his family|and an arbitrator|from|her family.|If|they both wish|reconciliation,|will cause reconciliation|Allah|between both of them.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knower,|All-Aware.
And worship|Allah|And (do) not|associate|with Him|anything,|and to the parents|(do) good,|and with|the relatives,|and the orphans,|and the needy|and the neighbor|(who is)|near,|and the neighbor|(who is) farther away,|and the companion|by your side|and the|traveler|and what|possess[ed]|your right hands.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|(the one) who|is|[a] proud|(and) [a] boastful.
Those who|are stingy|and order|the people|[of] stinginess|and hide|what|(has) given them|Allah|of|His Bounty -|and We (have) prepared|for the disbelievers|a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|spend|their wealth|to be seen|(by) the people|and not|they believe|in Allah|and not|in the Day|the Last,|and whoever|has|the Shaitaan|for him|(as) companion -|then evil|(is he as) a companion.
And what|(is) against them|if|they believed|in Allah|and the Day|the Last|and spent|from what|(has) provided them|Allah?|And is|Allah|about them|All-Knower.
Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|wrong|(as much as) weight|(of) an atom.|And if|there is|a good|He doubles it|and gives|from|near Him|a reward|great.
So how (will it be)|when|We bring|from|every|nation|a witness|and We bring|you|against|these (people)|(as) a witness.
(On) that Day|will wish|those who|disbelieved|and disobeyed|the Messenger|if|was leveled|with them|the earth|and not|they will (be able to) hide|(from) Allah|(any) statement.
O you|who|believe[d]!|(Do) not|go near|the prayer|while you|(are) intoxicated|until|you know|what|you are saying|and not|(when you are) impure|except|(when) passing|(through) a way|until|you have bathed.|And if|you are|ill|or|on|a journey|or|came|one|of you|from|the toilet,|or|you have touched|the women|and not|you find|water,|then do tayammum|(with) earth|clean|and wipe (with it)|your faces|and your hands.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Pardoning,|Oft-Forgiving.
Did not|you see,|[towards]|those who|were given|a portion|of|the Book,|purchasing|[the] error|and wishing|that|you stray|(from) the way?
And Allah|knows better|about your enemies|and (is) sufficient|Allah|(as) a Protector,|and sufficient|(is) Allah|(as) a Helper.
Of|those who|are Jews,|they distort|the words|from|their places|and they say,|"We hear[d]|and we disobey[ed]"|and "Hear|not|to be heard|and "Raina"|twisting|[with] their tongues|and defaming|[in]|the religion.|And if|[that] they|(had) said,|"We hear[d]|and we obey[ed]"|and "Hear|and look (at) us,"|surely it (would) have been|better|for them|and more suitable.|[And] but|cursed them|Allah|for their disbelief,|so not|they believe|except|a few.
O you|who|(have) been given|the Book,|believe|in what|We (have) revealed|confirming|what is|with you,|from|before|[that]|We efface|faces|and turn them|on|their backs|or|We curse them|as|We cursed|companions|(of) the Sabbath.|And is|(the) command|(of) Allah|(always) executed.
Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|forgive|that|partners be associated|with Him,|but He forgives|from|other than|that|for whom|He wills.|And whoever|associates partners|with Allah,|then surely|he has fabricated|a sin -|tremendous.
Do not|you see|[towards]|those who|claim purity|(for) themselves?|Nay,|(it is) Allah,|He purifies|whom|He wills|and not|they will be wronged|(even as much as) a hair on a date-seed.
See|how|they invent|about|Allah|[the] lie,|and sufficient|is it -|(as) a sin|manifest.
Do not|you see|[towards]|those who|were given|a portion|of|the Book?|They believe|in the superstition|and the false deities,|and they say|for those who|disbelieve[d]|"These|(are) better guided|than|those who|believe[d]|(as to the) way.
Those|(are) the ones|(who have been) cursed|(by) Allah,|and whoever|(is) cursed|(by) Allah|then never|will you find|for him|(any) helper.
Or|for them|(is) a share|of|the Kingdom?|Then|not would|they give|the people|(even as much as the) speck on a date seed.
Or|are they jealous|(of) the people|for|what|gave them|Allah|from|His Bounty?|But surely|We gave|(the) family|(of) Ibrahim|the Book|and [the] wisdom|and [We] gave them|a kingdom|great.
Then of them|(are some) who|believed|in him|and of them|(are some) who|turned away|from him,|and sufficient|(is) Hell|(as a) Blazing Fire.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|in Our Signs,|soon|We will burn them|(in) a Fire.|Every time|are roasted|their skins|We will change their|skins|for other (than) that,|so that they may taste|the punishment.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
And those who|believe[d]|and did|the good deeds|We will admit them|(in) Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers,|will abide|in it|forever.|For them|in it|(are) spouses|pure,|and We will admit them|(in the) shade|thick.
Indeed,|Allah|orders you|to|render|the trusts|to|their owners,|and when|you judge|between|the people|to|judge|with justice.|Indeed,|Allah|excellently|advises you|with it.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Hearing,|All-Seeing.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Obey|Allah|and obey|the Messenger|and those|(having) authority|among you.|Then if|you disagree|in|anything,|refer it|to|Allah|and the Messenger,|if|you|believe|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last.|That|(is) best|and more suitable|(for final) determination.
Do not|you see|[towards]|those who|claim|that they|believe|in what|(is) revealed|to you|and what|was revealed|from|before you?|They wish|to|go for judgment|to|the false deities|and surely|they were ordered|to|reject|[with] it.|And wishes|the Shaitaan|to|mislead them|astray -|far away.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Come|to|what|(has) revealed|Allah|and to|the Messenger,"|you see|the hypocrites|turning away|from you|(in) aversion.
So how|when|befalls them|disaster|for what|sent forth|their hands|then|they come to you|swearing|by Allah,|"Not|we intended|except|good|and reconciliation."
Those|(are) the ones who -|knows|Allah|what|(is) in|their hearts,|so turn away|from them|and admonish them,|and say|to them|concerning|their souls|a word|penetrating.
And not|We sent|any|Messenger|except|to be obeyed|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And if|[that] they,|when|they wronged|themselves,|(had) come to you|and asked forgiveness|(of) Allah,|and asked forgiveness|for them|the Messenger,|surely they would have found|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
But no,|by your Lord,|not|will they believe|until|they make you judge|about what|arises|between them,|then|not|they find|in|themselves|any discomfort|about what|you (have) decided|and submit|(in full) submission.
And if|[that] We|(had) decreed|on them|that,|"Kill|yourselves"|or|"Go forth|from|your homes,"|not|they would have done it|except|a few|of them.|But if|[that] they|had done|what|they were advised|with [it],|surely (it) would have been|better|for them|and stronger|strengthen(ing).
And then|We would (have) given them|from|Ourselves|a reward,|great.
And We would have guided them|(to the) way,|(the) straight.
And whoever|obeys|Allah|and the Messenger|then those|(will be) with|those whom|has bestowed (His) Favor|Allah|upon them -|of|the Prophets,|and the truthful,|and the martyrs,|and the righteous.|And excellent|(are) those|companion(s).
That|(is) the Bounty|of|Allah,|and sufficient|Allah,|(as) All-Knower.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Take|your precautions|and advance|(in) groups|or|advance|all together.
And indeed,|among you|(is he) who|lags behind|then if|befalls you|a disaster|he said,|"Verily|(has) favored|Allah|[on] me|[when]|(that) not|I was|with them,|present."
And if|befalls you|bounty|from|Allah|he would surely say|as if|(had) not|there been|between you|and between him|any affection,|"Oh! I wish|I had been|with them|then I would have attained|a success|great."
So let fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|those who|sell|the life|(of) the world|for the Hereafter.|And whoever|fights|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|then he is killed|or|achieves victory|then soon|We will grant him|a reward|a great.
And what|for you|(that) not|you fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|and (for) those who are weak|among|the men|and the women|and the children,|those who|say,|"Our Lord|take us out|of|this|[the] town|[the] oppressor(s)|(are) its people|and appoint|for us|from|Yourself|a protector|and appoint|for us|from|Yourself|a helper.
Those who|believe,|they fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah;|and those|who disbelieve,|they fight|in|(the) way|(of) the false deities.|So fight (against)|(the) friends|(of) the Shaitaan.|Indeed,|(the) strategy|(of) the Shaitaan|is|weak.
Have not|you seen|[towards]|those who|(when) it was said|to them,|"Restrain|your hands|and establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah?"|Then when|was ordained|on them|the fighting,|then|a group|of them|[they] fear|the people|as (they) fear|Allah|or|more intense|fear,|and they said,|"Our Lord|why|have You ordained|upon us|[the] fighting?|Why not|You postpone (it for) us|to|a term,|near."|Say,|"Enjoyment|(of) the world|(is) little|and the Hereafter|(is) better|for whoever|fears (Allah)|and not|you will be wronged|(even as much as) a hair on a date-seed."
Wherever|you be|will overtake you|[the] death|even if|you are|in|towers|lofty.|And if|befalls them|any good|they say,|"This|(is)|from|Allah."|And if|befalls them|any evil|they say,|"This|(is)|(from) you."|Say,|"All|(is)|from|Allah."|So what (is wrong)|(with) these|[the] people,|not|do they seem|(to) understand|any statement.
What(ever)|befalls you|of|(the) good|(is) from|Allah,|and whatever|befalls you|of|(the) evil|(is) from|yourself.|And We have sent you|for the people|(as) a Messenger,|and is sufficient|Allah|(as) a Witness.
(He) who|obeys|the Messenger|then surely|he obeyed|Allah,|and whoever|turns away -|then not|We (have) sent you|over them|(as) a guardian.
And they say,|"(We pledge) obedience."|Then when|they leave|from|you,|plan by night|a group|of them|other than|that which|you say.|But Allah|records|what|they plan by night.|So turn (away)|from them|and put (your) trust|in|Allah.|And sufficient|is Allah|(as) a Trustee.
Then (do) not|they ponder|(on) the Quran?|And if|it had (been)|(of)|from|other than|Allah,|surely they (would have) found|in it|contradiction,|much.
And when|comes to them|a matter|of|the security|or|[the] fear|they spread|[with] it.|But if|they (had) referred it|to|the Messenger|and to|those|(having) authority|among them,|surely would have known it|those who|draw correct conclusion (from) it|among them.|And if not|(had been the) bounty|(of) Allah|on you|and His Mercy,|surely you (would have) followed|the Shaitaan|except|a few.
So fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah;|not|are you responsible|except|(for) yourself.|And encourage|the believers,|perhaps|Allah|will|restrain|(the) might|(of) those who|disbelieved.|And Allah|(is) Stronger|(in) Might|and Stronger|(in) punishment.
Whoever|intercedes -|an intercession|good,|will have|for him|a share|of it;|and whoever|intercedes -|an intercession|evil,|will have|for him|a portion|of it.|And is|Allah|on|every|thing|a Keeper.
And when|you are greeted|with a greeting,|then greet|with better|than it|or|return it.|Indeed,|Allah|is|of|every|thing|an Accountant.
Allah -|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|surely He will gather you|to|(the) Day|(of) Resurrection -|no|doubt|about it.|And who|(is) more truthful|than|Allah|(in) statement.
So what|(is the matter) with you|concerning|the hypocrites (that)|(you have become) two parties?|While Allah|cast them back|for what|they earned.|Do you wish|that|you guide|whom|is let astray|(by) Allah?|And whoever|is let astray|(by) Allah,|then never|will you find|for him|a way.
They wish|if|you disbelieve|as|they disbelieved|and you would be|alike.|So (do) not|take|from them|allies|until|they emigrate|in|(the) way|(of) Allah.|But if|they turn back,|seize them|and kill them|wherever|you find them.|And (do) not|take|from them|any ally|and not|any helper,
Except|those who|join|[to]|a group|between you|and between them|(is) a treaty|or|those who come to you|restraining|their hearts|that|they fight you|or|they fight|their people.|And if|(had) willed|Allah,|surely He (would have) given them power|over you,|and surely they (would have) fought you.|So if|they withdraw from you|and (do) not|fight against you|and offer|to you|[the] peace|then not|(has) made|Allah|for you|against them|a way.
You will find|others|wishing|that|they be secure from you|and they be secure from|their people,|Everytime|that|they are returned|to|the temptation,|they are plunged|into it.|So if|not|they withdraw from you|and offer|to you|[the] peace|and they restrain|their hands,|then seize them|and kill them|wherever|you find them.|And those -|We made|for you|against them|an authority|clear.
And not|is|for a believer|that|he kills|a believer|except|(by) mistake.|And whoever|killed|a believer|(by) mistake,|then freeing|(of) a slave|- believing|and blood money|(is to be) paid|to|his family|unless|that|they remit (as) charity.|But if|(he) was|from|a people|hostile|to you|and he was|a believer|then freeing|(of) a believing slave.|- believing.|And if|(he) was|from|a people|between you|and between them,|(is) a treaty,|then blood money|(is to be) paid|to|his family,|and freeing|(of) a slave|- believing.|And whoever|(does) not|find,|then fasting|(for) two months|consecutively,|(seeking) repentance|from|Allah,|and is|Allah|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And whoever|kills|a believer|intentionally|then his recompense|(is) Hell,|abiding forever|in it|and will fall the wrath|(of) Allah|on him|and He (will) curse him|and He has prepared|for him|a punishment|great.
O you|who|believe[d]!|When|you go forth|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|then investigate,|and (do) not|say|to (the one) who|offers|to you|(a greeting of) peace,|"You are not|a believer,"|seeking|transitory gains|(of) the life|(of) the world,|for with|Allah|(are) booties|abundant.|Like that|you were|from|before,|then conferred favor|Allah|upon you;|so investigate.|Indeed,|Allah|is|of what|you do|All-Aware.
Not|(are) equal|the ones who sit|among|the believers,|other than|the ones (who are)|[the] disabled,|and the ones who strive|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|with their wealth|and their lives.|Preferred|(has) Allah|the ones who strive|with their wealth|and their lives|to|the ones who sit|(in) rank.|And (to) all|promised|(has) Allah|the best.|preferred|(has) Allah|the ones who strive|over|the ones who sit|(with) a reward|great,
Ranks|from Him|and forgiveness,|and mercy.|And is|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|those whom -|take them (in death)|the Angels|(while) they (were) wronging|themselves|they say,|"In what (condition)|were you?"|They said,|"We were|oppressed|in|the earth."|They said,|"Not|was|(the) earth|(of) Allah|spacious (enough)|so that you (could) emigrate|in it?"|Then those|(will have) their abode|(in) Hell -|and it is an evil|destination.
Except|the oppressed|among|the men|and the women|and the children|(who) not|are able to|plan|and not|they are directed|(to) a way.
Then those,|may be,|Allah|will|pardon|[on] them,|and is|Allah|Oft-Pardoning,|Oft-Forgiving.
And whoever|emigrates|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|will find|in|the earth|place(s) of refuge -|many,|and abundance.|And whoever|leaves|from|his home|(as) an emigrant|to|Allah|and His Messenger,|then|overtakes him|[the] death,|then certainly|(became) incumbent|his reward|on|Allah.|And is|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And when|you travel|in|the earth|then not|upon you|(is) any blame|that|you shorten|[of]|the prayer|if|you fear|that|(may) harm you|those who|disbelieved.|Indeed,|the disbelievers|are|for you|an enemy|open.
And when|you are|among them|and you lead|for them|the prayer,|then let stand|a group|of them|with you|and let them take|their arms.|Then when|they have prostrated,|then let them be|from|behind you|and let come (forward)|a group -|other,|(which has) not|prayed,|and let them pray|with you|and let them take|their precautions|and their arms.|Wished|those who|disbelieved|if|you neglect|[about]|your arms|and your baggage,|so (that) they (can) assault|[upon] you|(in) an attack,|single.|But (there is) no|blame|upon you|if|was|with you|any trouble|(because) of|rain|or|you are|sick|that|you lay down|your arms,|but take|your precautions.|Indeed,|Allah|has prepared|for the disbelievers|a punishment|humiliating.
Then when|you (have) finished|the prayer,|then remember|Allah|standing|and sitting|and (lying) on|your sides.|But when|you are secure|then establish|the (regular) prayer.|Indeed,|the prayer|is|on|the believers|prescribed|(at) fixed times.
And (do) not|be weak|in|pursuit|(of) the people.|If|you are|suffering,|then indeed, they|are (also) suffering|like what|you are suffering,|while you (have) hope|from|Allah|what|not|they hope.|And is|Allah|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
Indeed,|We (have) sent down|to you|the Book|with the truth|so that you may judge|between|the people|with what|has shown you|Allah.|And (do) not|be|for the deceitful|a pleader.
And seek forgiveness|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And (do) not|argue|for|those who|deceive|themselves.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|(the one) who|is|treacherous|(and) sinful.
They seek to hide|from|the people|but not|(can) they hide|from|Allah|and He|(is) with them|when|they plot by night|what|not|(does) he approve|of|the word.|And is|Allah|of what|they do -|All-Encompassing.
Here you are -|those who|[you] argue|for them|in|the life|(of) the world,|but who|will argue|(with) Allah|for them|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection|or|who|will be|[over them]|(their) defender.
And whoever|does|evil|or|wrongs|his soul|then|seeks forgiveness|(of) Allah|he will find|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And whoever|earns|sin,|then only|he earns it|against|his soul.|And is|Allah|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And whoever|earns|a fault|or|a sin|then|throws|it|(on) an innocent,|then surely|he (has) burdened (himself)|(with) a slander|and a sin|manifest.
And if not|(for the) Grace|(of) Allah|upon you|and His Mercy -|surely (had) resolved|a group|of them|to|mislead you.|But not|they mislead|except|themselves,|and not|they will harm you|in|anything.|And has sent down|Allah|to you|the Book|and [the] Wisdom|and taught you|what|not|you did|know.|And is|(the) Grace|(of) Allah|upon you|great.
(There is) no|good|in|much|of|their secret talk|except|(he) who|orders|charity|or|kindness|or|conciliation|between|the people.|And who|does|that|seeking|pleasure|(of) Allah|then soon|We will give him|a reward|great.
And whoever|opposes|the Messenger|from|after|what|(has) become clear|to him|(of) the guidance,|and he follows|other than|(the) way|(of) the believers,|We will turn him|(to) what|he (has) turned|and We will burn him|(in) Hell|and evil it is|(as) a destination.
Indeed,|Allah|does not|forgive|that|partners be associated|with Him,|but He forgives|[what]|other than|that|for whom|He wills.|And whoever|associates partners|with Allah|then surely|he lost (the) way,|straying|far away.
Not|they invoke|from|besides Him|but|female (deities)|and not|they invoke|except|Shaitaan -|rebellious.
He was cursed|by Allah|and he said,|"I will surely take|from|your slaves|a portion|appointed."
"And I will surely mislead them|and surely arouse desires in them,|and surely I will order them|so they will surely cut off|(the) ears|(of) the cattle|and surely I will order them|so they will surely change|(the) creation|(of) Allah."|And whoever|takes|the Shaitaan|(as) a friend|from|besides|Allah,|then surely|he (has) lost -|a loss|manifest.
He promises them|and arouses desires in them|and not|promises them|the Shaitaan -|except|deception.
Those -|their abode|(is) Hell|and not|they will find|from it|any escape.
And those who|believe[d]|and do|[the] righteous deeds|We will admit them|(in) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|will abide|in it|forever.|A Promise|(of) Allah|(in) truth,|and who|(is) truer|than|Allah|(in) statement?
Not|by your desire|and not|(by the) desire|(of the) People|(of) the Book.|Whoever|does|evil|will be recompensed|for it|and not|he will find|for him|from|besides|Allah|any protector|and not|any helper.
And whoever|does|[of]|[the] righteous deeds|from|(the) male|or|female,|and he|(is) a believer,|then those|will enter|Paradise|and not|they will be wronged|(even as much as) the speck on a date-seed.
And who|(is) better|(in) religion|than (one) who|submits|his face|to Allah|and he|(is) a good-doer|and follows|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim|(the) upright?|And was taken|(by) Allah|Ibrahim|(as) a friend.
And for Allah|(is) what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth,|and is|Allah|of every|thing|All-Encompassing.
And they seek your ruling|concerning|the women.|Say,|"Allah|gives you the ruling|about them|and what|is recited|to you|in|the Book|concerning|orphans|(of) girls|(to) whom|not|(do) you give them|what|is ordained|for them|and you desire|to|marry them,|and the ones who are weak|of|the children|and to|stand|for orphans|with justice.|And whatever|you do|of|good|then indeed,|Allah|is|about it|All-Knowing.
And if|a woman|fears|from|her husband|ill-conduct|or|desertion|then (there is) no|sin|on both of them|that|they make terms of peace|between themselves -|a reconciliation|and [the] reconciliation|(is) best.|And are swayed|the souls|(by) greed.|But if|you do good|and fear (Allah),|then indeed,|Allah|is|of what|you do|All-Aware.
And never|will you be able|to|deal justly|between|[the] women|even if|you desired,|but (do) not|incline|(with) all|the inclination|and leave her (the other)|like the suspended one.|And if|you reconcile|and fear (Allah)|then indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And if|they separate,|will be enriched|(by) Allah|each (of them)|from|His abundance,|and is|Allah|All-Encompassing,|All-Wise.
And for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And surely|We have instructed|those who|were given|the Book|from|before you|and yourselves|that|you fear|Allah.|But if|you disbelieve -|then indeed|for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And is|Allah|Free of need,|Praiseworthy.
And for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And is sufficient|Allah|(as) a Disposer of affairs.
If|He wills|He can take you away|O|people,|and bring|others.|And is|Allah|over|that|All-Powerful.
Whoever|[is]|desires|reward|(of) the world -|then with|Allah|(is the) reward|(of) the world|and the Hereafter.|And is|Allah|All-Hearing,|All-Seeing.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Be|custodians|of justice|(as) witnesses|to Allah,|even if|(it is) against|yourselves|or|the parents|and the relatives.|if|he be|rich|or|poor,|for Allah|(is) nearer|to both of them.|So (do) not|follow|the desire|lest|you deviate.|And if|you distort|or|refrain,|then indeed,|Allah|is|of what|you do|All-Aware.
O you|who|believe[d]!|Believe|in Allah|and His Messenger,|and the Book|which|He revealed|upon|His Messenger|and the Book|which|He revealed|from|before.|And whoever|disbelieves|in Allah|and His Angels,|and His Books,|and His Messengers|and the Day|the Last,|then surely|he (has) lost (the) way,|straying|far away.
Indeed,|those who|believed,|then|disbelieved,|then|(again) believed,|then|disbelieved,|then|increased|(in) disbelief -|not|will|Allah|forgive|[for] them|and not|will guide them|(to) a (right) way.
Give tidings|(to) the hypocrites|that|for them|(is) a punishment|painful -
Those who|take|the disbelievers|(as) allies|(from)|instead of|the believers.|Do they seek|with them|the honor?|But indeed,|the honor|(is) for Allah,|all.
And surely|He has revealed|to you|in|the Book|that|when|you hear|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|being rejected|[it]|and ridiculed|at [it],|then do not|sit|with them|until|they engage|in|a conversation|other than that.|Indeed, you|then,|(would be) like them.|Indeed,|Allah|will gather|the hypocrites|and the disbelievers|in|Hell|all together.
Those who|are waiting|for you.|Then if|was|for you|a victory|from|Allah|they say,|"Were not|we|with you?"|But if|(there) was|for the disbelievers|a chance|they said,|"Did not|we have advantage|over you|and we protected you|from|the believers?"|And Allah|will judge|between you|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|and never|will make|Allah|for the disbelievers|over|the believers|a way.
Indeed,|the hypocrites|(seek to) deceive|Allah|and (it is) He|who deceives them.|And when|they stand|for|the prayer,|they stand|lazily,|showing off|(to) the people|and not|they remember|Allah|except|a little.
Wavering|between|that,|not|to|these|and not|to|those.|And whoever|has been lead astray|(by) Allah -|then never|you will find|for him|a way.
O you|who|believe[d]!|(Do) not|take|the disbelievers|(as) allies|from|instead of|the believers.|Do you wish|that|you make|for Allah|against you|an evidence|clear?
Indeed,|the hypocrites|(will be) in|the depths,|the lowest,|of|the Fire,|and never|you will find|for them|any helper
Except|those who|repent|and correct (themselves)|and hold fast|to Allah|and are sincere|(in) their religion|for Allah,|then those (will be)|with|the believers.|And soon|will be given|(by) Allah|the believers|a reward,|great.
What|would do|Allah|by punishing you|if|you are grateful|and you believe?|And is|Allah|All-Appreciative,|All-Knowing.
(Does) not|love|Allah|the public mention|of [the] evil|[of]|[the] words|except|(by the one) who|has been wronged.|And is|Allah|All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
If|you disclose|a good|or|you conceal it|or|pardon|[of]|an evil,|then indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Pardoning,|All-Powerful.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|in Allah|and His Messengers|and they wish|that|they differentiate|between|Allah|and His Messengers|and they say,|"We believe|in some|and we disbelieve|in others."|And they wish|that|they take|between|that|a way.
Those -|they|(are) the disbelievers|truly.|And We have prepared|for the disbelievers|a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|believe|in Allah|and His Messengers|and not|they differentiate|between|(any) one|of them,|those -|soon|He will give them|their reward.|And is|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Ask you|(the) People|(of) the Book|that|you bring down|to them|a book|from|the heaven.|Then indeed,|they (had) asked|Musa|greater|than|that|for they said,|"Show us|Allah|manifestly,"|so struck them|the thunderbolt|for their wrongdoing.|Then|they took|the calf (for worship)|from|after|[what]|came to them|the clear proofs,|then We forgave them|for|that.|And We gave|Musa|an authority|clear.
And We raised|over them|the mount|for their covenant,|and We said|to them,|"Enter|the gate,|prostrating."|And We said|to them.|"(Do) not|transgress|in|the Sabbath."|And We took|from them|a covenant|solemn.
Then because of|their breaking|(of) their covenant|and their disbelief|in (the) Signs|(of) Allah|and their killing|(of) the Prophets|without|any right|and their saying,|"Our hearts|(are) wrapped."|Nay,|(has) set a seal|Allah|on their (hearts)|for their disbelief|so not|they believe|except|a few.
And for their disbelief|and their saying|against|Maryam|a slander|great.
And for their saying,|"Indeed, we|killed|the Messiah,|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah."|And not|they killed him|and not|they crucified him|but|it was made to appear (so)|to them.|And indeed,|those who|differ|in it|(are) surely in|doubt|about it.|Not|for them|about it|[of]|(any) knowledge|except|(the) following|(of) assumption.|And not|they killed him,|certainly.
Nay,|he was raised|(by) Allah|towards Him.|And is|Allah|All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
And (there is) not|from|(the) People|(of) the Book|but|surely he believes|in him|before|his death.|And (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|he will be|against them|a witness.
Then for (the) wrongdoing|of|those who|were Jews,|We made unlawful|for them|good things|which had been lawful|for them|and for their hindering|from|(the) way|(of) Allah -|many.
And for their taking|(of) [the] usury|while certainly|they were forbidden|from it|and (for) their consuming|wealth|(of) the people|wrongfully.|And We have prepared|for the disbelievers|among them|a punishment|painful.
But|the ones who are firm|in|the knowledge|among them|and the believers|believe|in what|(is) revealed|to you|and what|was revealed|from|before you.|And the ones who establish|the prayer|and the ones who give|the zakah|and the ones who believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last -|those,|We will give them|a reward,|great.
Indeed, We|have revealed|to you|as|We revealed|to|Nuh|and the Prophets|from|after him,|and We revealed|to|Ibrahim|and Ishmael,|and Isaac|and Yaqub,|and the tribes,|and Isa|and Ayyub,|and Yunus,|and Harun|and Sulaiman|and We gave|(to) Dawood|the Zaboor.
And Messengers|surely|We (have) mentioned them|to you|from|before|and Messengers|not|We (have) mentioned them|to you.|And spoke|Allah|(to) Musa|(in a) conversation.
Messengers,|bearers of glad tidings|and warners,|so that not|there is|for mankind|against|Allah|any argument|after|the Messengers.|And is|Allah|All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
But|Allah|bears witness|to what|He (has) revealed|to you.|He has sent it down|with His Knowledge|and the Angels|bear witness.|And is sufficient|Allah|(as) a Witness.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|and hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah,|surely|they have strayed,|straying|far away.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|and did wrong,|not|will|Allah|[to] forgive|them|and not|He will guide them|(to) a way,
Except|(the) way|(to) Hell,|abiding|in it|forever.|And is|that|for|Allah|easy.
O|mankind!|Surely|has come to you|the Messenger|with the truth|from|your Lord|so believe,|(it is) better|for you.|But if|you disbelieve,|then indeed,|to Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|And is|Allah|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
O People|(of) the Book!|(Do) not|commit excess|in|your religion|and (do) not|say|about|Allah|except|the truth.|Only|the Messiah,|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|(was) a Messenger|(of) Allah|and His word|which He conveyed|to|Maryam|and a spirit|from Him.|So believe|in Allah|and His Messengers.|And (do) not|say,|"Three;"|desist|(it is) better|for you.|Only|Allah|(is) God|One.|Glory be to Him!|That|He (should) have|for Him|a son.|To Him (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And is sufficient|Allah|(as) a Disposer of affairs.
Never|will disdain|the Messiah|to|be|a slave|of Allah|and not|the Angels,|the ones who are near (to Allah).|And whoever|disdains|from|His worship|and is arrogant|then He will gather them|towards Him|all together.
Then as for|those who|believed|and did|the righteous deeds|then He will give them in full|their reward|and give them more|from|His Bounty.|And as for|those who|disdained|and were arrogant|then He will punish them|(with) a punishment|painful,|and not|will they find|for themselves|from|besides|Allah|any protector|and not|any helper.
O|mankind!|Surely|has come to you|a convincing proof|from|your Lord,|and We (have) sent down|to you|a light,|clear.
So as for|those who|believed|in Allah|and held fast|to Him,|then He will admit them|in|Mercy|from Himself|and Bounty|and will guide them|to Himself|(on) a way,|straight.
They seek your ruling.|Say,|"Allah|gives you a ruling|concerning|the Kalala|if|a man|died|(and) not|he has|a child|and he has|a sister,|then for her|(is) a half|(of) what|he left.|And he|will inherit from her|if|not|is|for her|a child.|But if|there were|two females|then for them|two thirds|of what|he left.|But if|they were|brothers and sisters|men|and women,|then the male will have|like|share|(of) the two females.|makes clear|Allah|to you|lest|you go astray.|And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
O|you (who)|believe!|Fulfil|the contracts.|Are made lawful|for you|the quadruped|(of) the grazing livestock|except|what|is recited|on you,|not|being permitted|(to) hunt|while you|(are in) Ihram.|Indeed,|Allah|decrees|what|He wills.
O|you (who)|believe!|(Do) not|violate|(the) rites|(of) Allah,|and not|the month,|the sacred,|and not|the sacrificial animals|and not|the garlanded|and not|(those) coming|(to) the House,|the Sacred,|seeking|Bounty|of|their Lord|and good pleasure.|And when|you come out of Ihram|then (you may) hunt.|And let not|incite you|(the) hatred|(for) a people|as|they stopped you|from|Al-Masjid|Al-Haraam|that|you commit transgression.|And help one another|in|[the] righteousness|and [the] piety,|but (do) not|help one another|in|[the] sin|and [the] transgression.|And fear|Allah;|indeed,|Allah|(is) severe|(in) [the] punishment.
Are made unlawful|on you|the dead animals,|and the blood,|and flesh|(of) the swine,|and what|has been dedicated|to other than|Allah,|[on it],|and that which is strangled (to death),|and that which is hit fatally,|and that which has a fatal fall,|and that which is gored by horns,|and that which|ate (it)|the wild animal|except|what|you slaughtered,|and what|is sacrificed|on|the stone altars,|and that|you seek division|by divining arrows -|that|(is) grave disobedience.|This day|(have) despaired|those who|disbelieved|of|your religion,|so (do) not|fear them,|but fear Me.|This day|I have perfected|for you|your religion|and I have completed|upon you|My Favor|and I have approved|for you|[the] Islam|(as) a religion.|But whoever|(is) forced|by|hunger|(and) not|inclining|to sin,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
They ask you|what|(is) made lawful|for them.|Say,|"Are made lawful|for you|the good things|and what|you have taught|of|(your) hunting animals,|ones who train animals to hunt,|you teach them|of what|has taught you|Allah.|So eat|of what|they catch|for you,|but mention|(the) name|(of) Allah|on it,|and fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|is swift|(in taking) account.
This day|are made lawful|for you|the good things;|and (the) food|(of) those who|were given|the Book|(is) lawful|for you,|and your food|(is) lawful|for them.|And the chaste women|from|the believers|and the chaste women|from|those who|were given|the Book|from|before you,|when|you have given them|their bridal due,|being chaste|not|being lewd|and not|ones (who are) taking|secret lovers.|And whoever|denies|the faith -|then surely|(are) wasted|his deeds|and he,|in|the Hereafter,|(will be) among|the losers.
O you|who|believe!|When|you stand up|for|the prayer,|then wash|your faces|and your hands|till|the elbows|and wipe|your heads|and your feet|till|the ankles.|But if|you are|(in) a state of ceremonial impurity|then purify yourselves.|But if|you are|ill|or|on|a journey|or|has come|anyone|of you|from|the toilet|or|has (had) contact|(with) the women|and not|you find|water,|then do tayyammum|(with) earth|clean,|then wipe|your faces|and your hands|with it.|Does not|intend|Allah|to make|for you|any|difficulty|but|He intends|to purify you|and to complete|His Favor|upon you|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|upon you|and His covenant|which|He bound you|with [it]|when|you said,|"We heard|and we obeyed;"|and fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower|of what|(is in) the breasts.
O you|who|believe!|Be|steadfast|for Allah|(as) witnesses|in justice,|and let not|prevent you|hatred|(of) a people|[upon]|that not|you do justice.|Be just|it|(is) nearer|to [the] piety.|And fear|Allah;|indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
Has promised|Allah|those who|believe|and do|the righteous deeds -|for them|(is) forgiveness|and a reward|great.
And those who|disbelieve|and deny|Our Signs -|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Hellfire.
O you|who|believe!|Remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|upon you|when|determined|a people|that|they stretch|towards you|their hands,|but He restrained|their hands|from you.|And fear|Allah.|And upon|Allah|so let put the trust|the believers.
And certainly|took|Allah|a Covenant|(from the) Children|(of) Israel|and We appointed|among them|two|(and) ten|leaders.|And said|Allah,|"Indeed, I (am)|with you,|if|you establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah|and you believe|in My Messengers|and you assist them|and you loan|(to) Allah|a loan|goodly|surely I will remove|from you|your evil deeds|and I will surely admit you|(to) gardens|flow|from|underneath them|the rivers.|But whoever|disbelieved|after|that|among you,|then certainly|he strayed|(from) the way,|the right.
So for|their breaking|(of) their covenant|We cursed them|and We made|their hearts|hard.|They distort|the words|from|their places,|and forgot|a part|of what|they were reminded|of [it].|And not|will you cease|to discover|of|treachery|from them|except|a few|of them.|But forgive|them|and overlook.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the good-doers.
And from|those who|said,|Indeed we|(are) Christians,"|We took|their covenant;|but they forgot|a part|of what|they were reminded|of [it].|So We aroused|between them|[the] enmity|and [the] hatred|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|And soon|will inform them|Allah|of what|they used to|do.
O People|(of) the Book!|Surely|has come to you|Our Messenger|making clear|to you|much|of what|you used to|conceal|of|the Scripture|and overlooking|of|much.|Surely|has come to you|from|Allah|a light|and a Book,|clear.
Guides|with it|Allah|(those) who|seek|His pleasure|(to the) ways|(of) the peace,|and brings them out|from|the darknessess|to|the light|by His permission,|and guides them|to|(the) way,|(the) straight.
Certainly|disbelieved -|those who|said,|"Indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam."|Say,|"Then who|has power|against|Allah|(in) anything|if|He intends|to|destroy|the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam,|and his mother|and whoever|(is) in|the earth|all?"|And for Allah|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and what|(is) between both of them.|He creates|what|He wills,|and Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And said,|the Jews|and the Christians|"We (are)|(the) children|(of) Allah|and His beloved."|Say,|"Then why|(does He) punish you|for your sins?"|Nay,|you (are)|human beings|from among (those)|He created.|He forgives|[for] whom|He wills|and punishes|whom|He wills.|And for Allah|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them,|and to Him|(is) the final return.
O People|(of) the Book!|Surely|has come to you|Our Messenger,|he makes clear|to you|[on]|(after) an interval (of cessation)|of|the Messengers,|lest|you say|"Not|(has) come to us|any|bearer of glad tidings|and not|a warner."|But surely|has come to you|a bearer of glad tidings|and a warner.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And when|said|Musa|to his people,|"O my people,|remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|upon you|when|He placed|among you|Prophets|and made you|kings|and He gave you|what|not|He (had) given|(to) anyone|from|the worlds.
"O my people!|Enter|the land,|the Holy,|which|(has been) ordained|(by) Allah|for you|and (do) not|turn|on|your backs,|then you will turn back|(as) losers."
They said,|"O Musa!|Indeed,|in it|(are) people|(of) tyrannical strength|and indeed, we|never|will enter it|until|they leave|from it,|and if|they leave|[from] it|then certainly we (will)|enter (it)."
Said|two men|from|those who|feared (Allah),|(had) favored|Allah|[on] both of them,|"Enter|upon them|(through) the gate|then when|you have entered it|then indeed, you (will be)|victorious.|And upon|Allah|then put your trust|if|you are|believers.
They said,|O Musa!|Indeed, we|never|will enter it,|ever,|for|as long as they are|in it.|So go|you|and your Lord|and you both fight.|Indeed, we|are [here]|sitting."
He said|"O my Lord!|Indeed, I|(do) not|(have) power|except|(over) myself|and my brother,|so (make a) separation|between us|and between|the people,|(the) defiantly disobedient."
(Allah) said,|"Then indeed it|(will be) forbidden|to them|(for) forty|years,|they will wander|in|the earth.|So (do) not|grieve|over|the people,|the defiantly disobedient."
And recite|to them|the story|(of) two sons|(of) Adam,|in truth,|when|both offered|a sacrifice,|and it was accepted|from|one of them|and not|was accepted|from|the other.|Said (the latter),|"Surely I will kill you."|Said (the former),|"Only|accepts|(does) Allah|from|the God fearing.
If|you stretch|towards me|your hand|to kill me,|not|will I|stretch|my hand|towards you|to kill you,|indeed I|fear|Allah|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
"Indeed, I|wish|that|you be laden|with my sin|and your sin|so you will be|among|(the) companions|(of) the Fire,|and that|(is the) recompense|(of) the wrong-doers."
Then prompted|to him|his soul|(to) kill|his brother,|so he killed him|and became|of|the losers.
Then (was) sent|(by) Allah|a crow,|it (was) scratching|in|the earth|to show him|how|to hide|(the) dead body|(of) his brother.|He said,|"Woe to me!|Am I unable|that|I can be|like|this|[the] crow|and hide|(the) dead body|(of) my brother?"|Then he became|of|the regretful.
From|time|that,|We ordained|on|(the) Children|(of) Israel|that he|who|kills|a soul|other than|(for) a soul|or|(for) spreading corruption|in|the earth|then (it) is as if|he has killed|mankind,|all,|and whoever|saves it|then (it) is as if|he has saved|mankind.|all.|And surely|came to them|Our Messengers|with clear Signs|yet,|indeed,|many|of them|after|that|in|the earth|(are) surely those who commit excesses.
Only|(the) recompense|(for) those who|wage war|(against) Allah|and His Messenger|and strive|in|the earth|spreading corruption|(is) that|they be killed|or|they be crucified|or|be cut off|their hands|and their feet|of|opposite sides|or|they be exiled|from|the land.|That|(is) for them|disgrace|in|the world|and for them|in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|great.
Except|those who|repent|from|before|that|you overpower|[over] them,|then know|that|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you|who|believe!|Fear|Allah|and seek|towards Him|the means|and strive hard|in|His way,|so that you may|succeed.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve,|if|that|for them|(is) what|(is) in|the earth|all|and the like of it|with it,|to ransom themselves|with it,|from|(the) punishment|(of the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|not|will be accepted|from them,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
They will wish|that|they come out|of|the Fire|but not|they|will come out|of it.|And for them|(is) a punishment|lasting.
And (for) the male thief|and the female thief -|[then] cut off|their hands|(as) a recompense|for what|they earned|(as) an exemplary (punishment)|from|Allah.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
But whoever|repented|from|after|his wrongdoing|and reforms,|then indeed,|Allah|will turn in forgiveness|to him.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Do not|you know|that|Allah,|to Him (belongs)|(the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth?|He punishes|whom|He wills|and He forgives|[to] whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
O|Messenger!|Let not|grieve you|those who|hasten|in (to)|[the] disbelief -|of|those who|said,|"We believe"|with their mouths|and not|believe|their hearts,|and from|those who|(are) Jews.|They (are) listeners|to falsehood,|(and) listeners|for people,|other,|(who have) not|come to you.|They distort|the words|from|after|their context,|saying,|"If|you are given|this|[so] take it|but if|not|you are given it|then beware."|And (for) whom|intends|Allah|his trial,|then never|will you have power|for him|against|Allah|anything.|Those|(are) the ones|never|will intend|Allah|that|He purifies|their hearts.|For them|in|the world|(is) disgrace|and for them|in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|great.
Listeners|to [the] falsehood,|devourers|of the forbidden.|So if|they come to you|then judge|between them|or|turn away|from them.|And if|you turn away|from them,|then never|will they harm you|(in) anything.|And if|you judge,|then judge|between them|with [the] justice.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the ones who are just.
But how can|they appoint you a judge|while they (have) with them|the Taurat,|in it|(is the) Command|(of) Allah?|Then|they turn away|from|after|that,|and not|those|(are) the believers.
Indeed,|We revealed|the Taurat|in it|(was) Guidance|and light;|judged|by it|the Prophets,|those who|had submitted (to Allah)|for those who|were Jews,|and the Rabbis,|and the scholars,|with what|they were entrusted|of|(the) Book|(of) Allah|and they were|to it|witnesses.|So (do) not|fear|the people|but fear Me,|and (do) not|sell|My Verses|(for) a price,|little.|And whoever|(does) not|judge|by what|has revealed|Allah,|then those|[they]|(are) the disbelievers.
And We ordained|for them|in it|that -|the life|for the life,|and the eye|for the eye,|and the nose|for the nose,|and the ear|for the ear,|and the tooth|for the tooth,|and (for) wounds|(is) retribution.|But whoever|gives charity|with it,|then it is|an expiation|for him.|And whoever|(does) not|judge|by what|has revealed|Allah,|then those|[they]|(are) the wrongdoers.
And We sent|on|their footsteps|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|confirming|what|(was) between|his hands|of|the Taurat,|and We gave him|the Injeel,|in it|(was) Guidance|and light|and confirming|what|(was) between|his hands|of|the Taurat|and a Guidance|and an admonition|for the God conscious.
And let judge|(the) People|(of) the Injeel|by what|has revealed|Allah|in it.|And whoever|(does) not|judge|by what|has revealed|Allah|then those|[they] (are)|the defiantly disobedient.
And We revealed|to you|the Book|in [the] truth,|confirming|what|(was) before|his hands|of|the Book|and a guardian|over it.|So judge|between them|by what|has revealed|Allah|and (do) not|follow|their vain desires|when|has come to you|of|the truth.|For each|We have made|for you|a law|and a clear way.|And if|(had) willed|Allah|He (would have) made you|a community,|one,|[and] but|to test you|in|what|He (has) given you,|so race|(to) the good.|To|Allah|you will return,|all,|then He will inform you|of what|you were|concerning it|differing.
And that|you judge|between them|by what|(has) revealed|Allah|and (do) not|follow|their vain desires|and beware of them|lest|they tempt you away|from|some|(of) what|has revealed|Allah|to you.|And if|they turn away|then know that|only|intends|Allah|to|afflict them|for some|(of) their sins.|And indeed,|many|of|the people|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Is it then the judgment|(of the time of) ignorance|they seek?|And who (is)|better|than|Allah|(in) judgment|for a people|(who) firmly believe.
O you|who|believe!|(Do) not|take|the Jews|and the Christians|(as) allies.|Some of them|(are) allies|(to) others.|And whoever|takes them as allies|among you,|then indeed, he|(is) of them.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the people,|the wrongdoing.
And you see|those -|in|their hearts|(is) a disease|they hasten|to them|saying,|"We fear|that|(may) strike us|a misfortune."|But perhaps|Allah|[that]|will bring|the victory|or|a decision|from|(of) Him.|Then they will become|for|what|they had concealed|within|themselves,|regretful.
And will say|those who|believe,|"Are these|those who|swore|by Allah|strongest,|(of) their oaths,|indeed, they|(were) with you?"|Became worthless|their deeds,|and they became|(the) losers.
O you|who|believe!|Whoever|turns back|among you|from|his religion,|then soon|(will be) brought|(by) Allah|a people|whom He loves|and they love Him,|humble|towards|the believers|(and) stern|towards|the disbelievers;|striving|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and not|fearing|the blame|(of) a critic.|That|(is the) Grace|(of) Allah,|He grants|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
Only|your ally|(is) Allah|and His Messenger,|and those who|believe,|and those who|establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and they|(are) those who bow down.
And whoever|takes as an ally|Allah|and His Messenger|and those who|believe,|then indeed.|(the) party|(of) Allah -|they|(are) the victorious.
O you|who|believe!|(Do) not|take|those who|take|your religion|(in) ridicule|and fun|from|those who|are given|the Book|from|before you|and the disbelievers|(as) allies.|And fear|Allah,|if|you are|believers.
And when|you make a call|for|the prayer,|they take it|(in) ridicule|and fun.|That|(is) because they|(are) a people|(who do) not|understand.
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book!|Do|you resent|[of] us|except|that|we believe|in Allah|and what|has been revealed|to us|and what|was revealed|from|before,|and that|most of you|(are) defiantly disobedient."
Say,|"Shall|I inform you|(of) worse|than|that|(as) recompense|from|Allah?|Whom|has (been) cursed|(by) Allah|and He became angry|with him|and made|of them|[the] apes|and [the] swines,|and (who) worshipped|the false deities.|Those|(are) worse|(in) position|and farthest astray|from|(the) even|way."
And when|they come to you|they say,|"We believe."|But certainly|they entered|with disbelief|and they|certainly|went out|with it.|And Allah|knows best|[of] what|they were|hiding.
And you see|many|of them|hastening|into|[the] sin|and [the] transgression|and eating|the forbidden.|Surely evil|(is) what|they were|doing.
Why (do) not|forbid them,|the Rabbis|and the religious scholars|from|their saying|the sinful|and their eating|(of) the forbidden?|Surely, evil|(is) what|they used to|do.
And said|the Jews,|"The Hand|(of) Allah|(is) chained."|Are chained|their hands,|and they have been cursed|for what|they said.|Nay,|His Hands|(are) stretched out|He spends|how|He wills.|And surely increase|many|of them,|what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord,|(in) rebellion|and disbelief.|And We have cast|among them|[the] enmity|and [the] hatred|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|Every time|they kindled|(the) fire|of [the] war,|it (was) extinguished|(by) Allah.|And they strive|in|the earth|spreading corruption.|And Allah|(does) not|love|the corrupters.
And if|that|(the) People|(of) the Book|(had) believed|and feared (Allah),|surely We (would have) removed|from them|their evil (deeds)|and surely We (would have) admitted them|(to) Gardens|(of) Bliss.
And if|that they|had stood firmly|(by) the Taurat|and the Injeel|and what|was revealed|to them|from|their Lord,|surely they (would have) eaten|from|above them|and from|beneath|their feet.|Among them|(is) a community|moderate,|but many|of them -|evil|(is) what|they do.
O|Messenger!|Convey|what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord,|and if|not|you do|then not|you (have) conveyed|His Message.|And Allah|will protect you|from|the people.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the people,|the disbelieving.
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book!|You are not|on|anything|until|you stand firmly|(by) the Taurat|and the Injeel|and what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord.|And surely increase|many|of them,|what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord,|(in) rebellion|and disbelief.|So (do) not|grieve|over|the people,|the disbelieving.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and those who|became Jews|and the Sabians|and the Christians,|whoever|believed|in Allah|and the Day,|the Last|and did|good deeds,|then no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
Certainly|We took|a Covenant|(from the) Children|(of) Israel|and We sent|to them|Messengers.|Whenever|came to them|any Messenger|with what|not|desired|their souls,|a group|they denied|and a group|they kill.
And they thought|that not|will be (for them)|a trial,|so they became blind|and they became deaf.|Then|turned|Allah|to them,|then (again)|they became blind|and they became deaf,|many|of them.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of what|they do.
Certainly|disbelieved|those who|say,|"Indeed|Allah -|He|(is) the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam."|While said|the Messiah,|"O Children|(of) Israel!|Worship|Allah,|my Lord|and your Lord."|Indeed, he|who|associates partners|with Allah,|then surely|(has) forbidden|Allah|for him|Paradise|and his abode|(will be) the Fire.|And not|for the wrongdoers|any|helpers.
Certainly|disbelieved|those who|say,|"Indeed|Allah|(is the) third|(of) three."|And (there is) no|[of]|god|except|(the) God,|(the) One.|And if|not|they desist|from what|they are saying|surely will afflict|those who|disbelieved|among them,|a punishment|painful.
So will not|they turn in repentance|to|Allah|and seek His forgiveness?|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Not|(is) the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam|but|a Messenger,|certainly|had passed|from|before him|the Messengers.|And his mother|(was) truthful.|They both used to|eat|[the] food.|See|how|We make clear|to them|the Signs,|then|see|how|they are deluded.
Say,|"Do you worship|from|besides|Allah|what|not|has power|to (cause) you|any harm|and not|any benefit,|while Allah,|He|(is) the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing?
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book!|(Do) not|exceed|in|your religion|other than|the truth,|and (do) not|follow|(vain) desires|(of) a people|certainly|who went astray|from|before,|and they misled|many,|and they have strayed|from|(the) right|[the] way.
Were cursed|those who|disbelieved|from|(the) Children|(of) Israel|by|(the) tongue|(of) Dawood|and Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|that (was)|because|they disobeyed|and they were|transgressing.
They had been|not|forbidding each other|from|wrongdoing|they did [it].|Surely, evil|(was) what|they were|doing.
You see|many|of them|taking as allies|those who|disbelieved.|Surely evil|(is) what|sent forth|for them|their souls,|that|became angry|Allah|with them|and in|the punishment|they|(will) abide forever.
And if|they had|believed|in Allah|and the Prophet|and what|has been revealed|to him,|not|they (would have) taken them|(as) allies;|[and] but|many|of them|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Surely you will find|strongest|(of) the people|(in) enmity|to those who|believe,|the Jews|and those who|(are) polytheists;|and surely you will find|nearest of them|(in) affection|to those who|believe,|those who|say,|"We|(are) Christians."|That (is)|because|among them|(are) priests|and monks,|and that they|(are) not|arrogant.
And when|they listen|(to) what|has been revealed|to|the Messenger,|you see|their eyes|overflowing|with|the tears,|for what|they recognized|of|the truth.|They say,|"Our Lord,|we have believed|so write us|with|the witnesses.
And what|for us (that)|not|we believe|in Allah|and what|came (to) us|from|the truth?|And we hope|that|will admit us|our Lord|with|the people,|the righteous."
So rewarded them|Allah|for what|they said|(with) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers,|will abide forever|in it.|And that|(is the) reward|(of) the good-doers.
And those who|disbelieved|and denied|Our Signs,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Hellfire.
O you|who|believe!|(Do) not|make unlawful|(the) good things|(of) what|has (been) made lawful|(by) Allah|for you,|and (do) not|transgress.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|the transgressors.
And eat|of what|has provided you|Allah -|lawful|good.|And fear|Allah,|the One|you (are)|in Him|believers.
Not|will call you to account|Allah|for the thoughtless utterances|in|your oaths|but|He will call you to account|for what|you contracted|(of) the oath.|So its expiation|(is) feeding|(of) ten|needy people|of|average|(of) what|you feed|your families|or|clothing them|or|freeing|a slave.|But whoever|(does) not|find|(that), then fasting|(for) three|days.|That|(is the) expiation|(of) your oaths|when|you have sworn.|And guard|your oaths.|Thus|makes clear|Allah|to you|His Verses|so that you may|(be) grateful.
O you|who|believe!|Verily|the intoxicants|and [the] games of chance|and (sacrifices at) altars|and divining arrows|(are an) abomination|from|(the) work|(of) the Shaitaan,|so avoid it|so that you may|(be) successful.
Only|intends|the Shaitaan|to|cause|between you|[the] enmity|and [the] hatred|through|intoxicants|and gambling,|and hinders you|from|(the) remembrance|(of) Allah|and from|the prayer.|So will|you|(be) the ones who abstain?
And obey|Allah|and obey|the Messenger|and beware.|And if|you turn away,|then know|only|upon|Our Messenger|(is to) convey (the Message)|clearly.
Not|on|those who|believe|and do|the good deeds|any sin|for what|they ate|when|that|they fear (Allah)|and they believe|and they do|[the] good deeds|then|they fear (Allah)|and believe,|then|they fear (Allah)|and do good,|and Allah|loves|the good-doers.
O you|who|believe!|Surely will test you|Allah|through something|of|the game -|can reach it|your hands|and your spears|that may make evident|Allah|who|fears Him|in the unseen.|And whoever|transgressed|after|that,|then for him|(is) a punishment|painful.
O you|who|believe!|(Do) not|kill|the game|while you|(are in) Ihram.|And whoever|killed it|among you|intentionally,|then penalty|(is) similar|(to) what|he killed|of|the cattle,|judging|it|two men,|just,|among you|(as) an offering|reaching|the Kabah|or|an expiation -|feeding|needy people|or|equivalent|(of) that|(in) fasting,|that he may taste|(the) consequence|(of) his deed.|Pardoned|(by) Allah|what|(has) passed,|but whoever|returned,|then will take retribution|Allah|from him.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|Owner|(of) Retribution.
Is made lawful|for you|game|(of) the sea|and its food|(as) provision|for you|and for the travelers,|and is made unlawful|on you|game|(of) the land|as|long as you|(are in) Ihram,|And be conscious|(of) Allah|the One|to Him|you will be gathered.
Has (been) made|(by) Allah|the Kabah,|the House,|the Sacred,|an establishment|for mankind|and the month(s)|[the] sacred|and the (animals) for offering|and the garlands.|That (is)|so that you may know|that|Allah|knows|what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth,|and that|Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knowing.
Know|that|Allah|(is) severe|(in) punishment|and that|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Not|on|the Messenger|except|the conveyance.|And Allah|knows|what|you reveal|and what|you conceal.
Say,|"Not|(are) equal|the evil|and the good|even if|impresses you|abundance|(of) the evil.|So fear|Allah,|O men|(of) understanding,|so that you may|(be) successful."
O you|who|believe!|(Do) not|ask|about|things|if|made clear|to you,|it may distress you|and if|you ask|about it|when|is being revealed|the Quran|it would be made clear|to you.|has (been) pardoned|(by) Allah|[about] it,|and Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Forbearing.
Indeed,|asked them|a people|from|before you,|then|they became|thereby|disbelievers.
Not|has (been) made|(by) Allah|of|a Bahirah|and not|a Saibah|and not|a Wasilah|and not|a Hami.|[And] but|those who|disbelieved|they invent|against|Allah|the lie,|and most of them|(do) not|use reason.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Come|to|what|has (been) revealed|(by) Allah|and to|the Messenger,"|they said,|"Sufficient for us|(is) what|we found|upon it|our forefathers."|Even though|(that)|their forefathers|(were) not|knowing|anything|and not|they (were) guided?
O you|who|believe!|Upon you|(is to guard) yourselves.|Not|will harm you|(those) who|(have gone) astray|when|you have been guided.|To|Allah|(is) your return -|all;|then He will inform you|of what|you used to|do.
O you|who|believe!|(Take) testimony|among you|when|approaches|one of you|[the] death,|(at the) time (of making)|[the] a will|two|men,|just,|among you,|or|two others|from|other than you|if|you|(are) travel(ing)|in|the earth|then befalls you|calamity|(of) [the] death.|Detain both of them|from|after|the prayer|and let them both swear|by Allah|if|you doubt,|"Not|we will exchange|it for|a price|even if|he is|(of)|a near relative,|and not|we will conceal|testimony|(of) Allah.|Indeed, we|then|(will) surely (be) of|the sinners."
Then if|it is discovered|(on)|that the two|(were) guilty|(of) sin,|then (let) two others|stand|(in) their place|from|those who|have a lawful right|over them -|the former two -|and let them both swear|by Allah|"Surely our testimony|(is) truer|than|testimony of the other two|and not|we have transgressed.|Indeed, we|then|(will be) of|the wrongdoers."
That|(is) closer|that|they will give|the testimony|in|its (true) form|or|they would fear|that|will be refuted|their oaths|after|their (others) oaths.|And fear|Allah|and listen;|and Allah|(does) not|guide|the people.|the defiantly disobedient.
(The) day|will (be) gathered|(by) Allah|the Messengers|and He will say,|"What|was (the) response you received?"|They said,|"(There is) no|knowledge|for us.|Indeed You,|You|(are the) Knower|(of) the unseen."
When|said|Allah,|"O Isa,|son|(of) Maryam!|Remember|My Favor|upon you|and upon|your mother|when|I strengthened you|with (the) Spirit,|the Holy,|you spoke|(to) the people|in|the cradle|and (in) maturity.|And when|I taught you|the Book|and the wisdom|and the Taurat|and the Injeel;|and when|you make|from|the clay|like the shape|(of) the bird|by My permission|then you breath|into it|and it becomes|a bird|by My permission,|and you heal|the born blind|and the leper|by My permission,|and when|you bring forth|the dead|by My permission.|And when|I restrained|(the) Children|(of) Israel|from you|when|you came to them|with the clear proofs|then said|those who|disbelieved|among them|"Not|(is) this|but|magic,|clear."
And when|I inspired|to|the disciples|to|believe|in Me|and in My Messenger|they said,|"We believe|and bear witness|that indeed we|(are) Muslims.
When|said|the disciples,|"O Isa,|son|(of) Maryam!|Is|able|your Lord|to|send down|to us|a table spread|from|the heaven?"|He said,|"Fear|Allah,|if|you are|believers."
They said,|"We wish|that|we eat|from it|and satisfy|our hearts|and we know|that|certainly|you have spoken the truth to us|and we be|over it|among|the witnesses.
Said|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|"O Allah,|our Lord,|send down|to us|a table spread|from|the heaven|to be|for us|a festival|for first of us|and last of us|and a sign|from You.|And provide us,|and You|(are) best|(of) the providers.
Said|Allah,|"Indeed I|(will) send it down|to you,|then whoever|disbelieves|after (that)|among you,|then indeed I|[I] will punish him|(with) a punishment|not|I have punished|anyone|among|the worlds."
And when|said|Allah,|"O Isa,|son|(of) Maryam!|Did you|say|to the people,|"Take me|and my mother|(as) two gods|from|besides|Allah?"|He said,|"Glory be to You!|Not|was|for me|that|I say|what|not|I|(had) right.|If|I had|said it,|then surely|You would have known it.|You know|what|(is) in|myself,|and not|I know|what|(is) in|Yourself.|Indeed, You,|You|(are) All-Knower|(of) the unseen.
Not|I said|to them|except|what|You commanded me|[with it]|that|"You worship|Allah,|my Lord|and your Lord."|And I was|over them|a witness|that|as long as I|(was) among them,|then when|You raised me|You were|[You]|the Watcher|over them,|and You|(are) on|every|thing|a Witness.
If|You punish them,|then indeed they|(are) Your slaves,|and if|You forgive|[for] them|then indeed You,|You|(are) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise."
Will say|Allah,|"This|Day|will profit|the truthful|their truthfulness."|For them|(are) Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers|will abide|in it|forever."|is pleased|Allah|with them|and they are pleased|with Him.|That|(is) the success,|(the) great.
To Allah (belongs)|the dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and what|(is) in them.|And He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
(All) the praises and thanks|(be) to Allah,|the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|and made|the darkness[es]|and the light.|Then|those who|disbelieved|in their Lord|equate others with Him.
He|(is) the One Who|created you|from|clay|then|He decreed|a term -|and a term|specified|with Him,|yet|you|doubt.
And He|(is) Allah|in|the heavens|and in|the earth.|He knows|your secret|and what you make public|and He knows|what|you earn.
And not|comes to them|[of]|any sign|from|(the) Signs|(of) their Lord|but|they are|from it|turning away.
Then indeed,|they denied|the truth|when|it came to them,|but soon|will come to them|news|(of) what|they used to|[at it]|mock.
Did not|they see|how many|We destroyed|from|before them|of|generations|We had established them|in|the earth|what|not|We (have) established|for you?|And We sent|(rain from) the sky|upon them|showering abundantly|and We made|the rivers|flow|from|underneath them.|Then We destroyed them|for their sins|and We raised|from|after them|generations,|other.
And (even) if|We (had) sent down|to you|a written Scripture|in|a parchment|and they touched it|with their hands,|surely (would) have said|those who|disbelieved,|"Not|(is) this|but|magic,|clear."
And they said,|"Why has not been|sent down|to him|an Angel?"|And if|We (had) sent down|an Angel,|surely (would) have been decided|the matter|then|no|respite would have been granted to them.
And if|We had made him|an Angel,|certainly We (would) have made him|a man,|and certainly We (would) have obscured|to them|what|they are obscuring.
And indeed|were mocked|Messengers|from|before you|but surrounded|those who|scoffed|of them|what|they used to|[at it]|mock.
Say,|"Travel|in|the earth|and|see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the rejecters."
Say,|"To whom (belongs)|what|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth?"|Say,|"To Allah."|He has decreed|upon|Himself|the Mercy.|Surely He will assemble you|on|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|(there is) no|doubt|about it.|Those who|have lost|themselves,|then they|(do) not|believe.
And for Him|(is) whatever|dwells|in|the night|and the day,|and He|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Say,|"Is it other than|Allah|I (should) take|(as) a protector,|Creator,|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|while (it is) He|Who feeds|and not|He is fed?"|Say,|"Indeed I|[I] am commanded|that|I be|(the) first|who|submits (to Allah)|and not|be|of|the polytheists."
Say,|"Indeed, I|[I] fear|if|I disobeyed|my Lord,|punishment|(of) a Day,|Mighty."
Whoever|is averted|from it|that Day|then surely|He had Mercy on him.|And that|(is) the success|(the) clear.
And if|touches you|Allah|with affliction|then no|remover|of it|except|Him.|And if|He touches you|with good,|then He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And He|(is) the Subjugator|over|His slaves.|And He|(is) the All-Wise,|the All-Aware.
Say,|"What|thing|(is) greatest|(as) a testimony?"|Say,|"Allah|(is) Witness|between me|and between you,|and has been revealed|to me|this|[the] Quran|that I may warn you|with it|and whoever|it reaches.|Do you truly|testify|that|with|Allah|(there are) gods|other?"|Say,|Not|(do) I testify.|Say,|"Only|He|(is) God,|One.|and indeed, I am|free|of what|you associate (with Him).
Those (to) whom|We have given them|the Book|they recognize him|as|they recognize|their sons.|Those who|lost|themselves|then they|(do) not|believe.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (he) who|invents|against|Allah|a lie|or|rejects|His Signs?|Indeed,|not|will be successful|the wrongdoers.
And (the) Day|We will gather them|all,|then|We will say|to those who|associated others with Allah,|"Where (are)|your partners,|those whom|you used to|claim?"
Then|not|will be|(for) them a plea|except|that|they say,|"By Allah,|our Lord,|not|we were|those who associated others (with Allah)."
Look|how|they lied|against|themselves.|And lost|from them|what|they used to|invent.
And among them|(are those) who|listen|to you,|but We have placed|over|their hearts|coverings|lest|they understand it,|and in|their ears|deafness.|And if|they see|every|sign|not|will they believe|in it.|Until,|when|they come to you|and argue with you|say|those who|disbelieved,|"Not|(is) this|but|(the) tales|(of) the former (people)."
And they|forbid (others)|from it|and they keep away|from it.|And not|they destroy|except|themselves|and not|they perceive.
And if|you (could) see|when|they are made to stand|by|the Fire|then they (will) say,|"Oh! Would that we|were sent back|and not|we would deny|(the) Signs|(of) our Lord|and we would be|among|the believers."
Nay,|became manifest|for them|what|they used to|conceal|from|before.|And if|they were sent back|certainly they (would) return|to what|they were forbidden|from it,|and indeed they|certainly are liars.
And they said,|"Not|it (is)|except|our life|(of) the world|and not|we|(will be) resurrected."
And if|you (could) see|when|they will be made to stand|before|their Lord.|He (will) say,|"Is not|this|the truth?"|They will say,|"Yes,|by our Lord."|He (will) say,|"So taste|the punishment|because|you used to|disbelieve."
Indeed,|incurred loss|those who|denied|in (the) meeting|(with) Allah,|until|when|came to them|the Hour|suddenly|they said,|"Oh! Our regret|over|what|we neglected|concerning it,"|while they|will bear|their burdens|on|their backs.|Unquestionably!|Evil|(is) what|they bear.
And not|(is) the life|(of) the world|except|a play|and amusement;|but the home|(of) the Hereafter|(is) best|for those who|(are) God conscious.|Then not|(will) you reason?
Indeed,|We know|that it|grieves you|what|they say.|And indeed, they|(do) not|deny you|but|the wrongdoers -|the Verses|(of) Allah|they reject.
And surely|were rejected|Messengers|from|before you,|but they were patient|over|what|they were rejected|and they were harmed|until|came to them|Our help.|And no|one (can) alter|(the) words|(of) Allah,|and surely|has come to you|of|(the) news|(of) the Messengers.
And if|is|difficult|for you|their aversion|then if|you are able|to|seek|a tunnel|in|the earth|or|a ladder|into|the sky|so that you bring to them|a Sign.|But if|(had) willed|Allah|surely He (would) have gathered them|on|the guidance.|So (do) not|be|of|the ignorant.
Only|respond|those who|listen.|But the dead -|will resurrect them|Allah|then|to Him|they will be returned.
And they said,|"Why (is) not|sent down|to him|a Sign|from|his Lord?"|Say,|"Indeed|Allah|(is) Able|[on]|to|send down|a Sign,|but|most of them|(do) not|know."
And not|[of]|any animal|in|the earth|and not|a bird|(that) flies|with its wings -|but|(are) communities|like you.|Not|We have neglected|in|the Book|[of]|anything,|then|to|their Lord|they will be gathered.
And those who|rejected|Our Verses|(are) deaf|and dumb|in|the darkness[es].|Whoever|wills|Allah -|He lets him go astray|and whoever|He wills -|He places him|on|(the) way,|(the) straight.
Say,|"Have you seen|if|(there) came to you|punishment|(of) Allah|or|(there) came to you|the Hour -|is it other|(than) Allah|you call,|if|you are|truthful?"
"Nay,|Him Alone|you call|and He would remove|what|you call|upon Him|if|He wills,|and you will forget|what|you associate (with Him)."
And certainly|We sent (Messengers)|to|nations|from|before you,|then We seized them|with adversity|and hardship|so that they may|humble themselves.
Then why not|when|came to them|Our punishment,|they humbled themselves?|But|became hardened|their hearts|and made fair-seeming|to them|the Shaitaan|what|they used to|do.
So when|they forgot|what|they were reminded|of [it],|We opened|on them|gates|(of) every|thing,|until|when|they rejoiced|in what|they were given,|We seized them|suddenly|and then|they|(were) dumbfounded.
So was cut off|(the) remnant|(of) the people|[those] who|did wrong.|And all praises and thanks|(be) to Allah|Lord|(of) the worlds.
Say,|"Have you seen|if|took away|Allah|your hearing|and your sight|and sealed|[on]|your hearts,|who|(is the) god|other than|Allah|to bring [back] to you|with it?|See|how|We explain|the Signs;|yet|they|turn away."
Say,|"Have you seen|if|comes to you|punishment|(of) Allah|suddenly|or|openly,|will|(any) be destroyed|except|the people -|the wrongdoers?
And not|We send|the Messengers|except|(as) bearer of glad tidings|and (as) warners.|So whoever|believed|and reformed,|then no|fear|upon them|and not|they|will grieve.
And those who|denied|[in] Our Verses|will touch them|the punishment|for what|they used to|defiantly disobey.
Say,|"Not|(do) I say|to you|(that) with me|(are the) treasures|(of) Allah|and not|(that) I know|the unseen|and not|I say|to you|that I (am)|an Angel.|Not|(do) I follow|except|what|is revealed|to me."|Say,|"Can|be equal|the blind|and the seeing one?"|Then will not|you give thought?
And warn|with it|those who|fear|that|they will be gathered|to|their Lord,|not|for them|of|other than Him|any protector|and not|any intercessor,|so that they may|(become) righteous.
And (do) not|send away|those who|call|their Lord|in the morning|and the evening|desiring|His Countenance.|Not|(is) on you|of|their account|[of]|anything,|and not|from|your account|on them|[of]|anything.|So were you to send them away,|then you would be|of|the wrongdoers.
And thus|We try|some of them|with others|that they say,|"Are these|(whom has been) favored|(by) Allah|[upon them]|from|among us?"|is not|Allah|most knowing|of those who are grateful?
And when|come to you|those who|believe|in Our Verses|then say,|"Peace|(be) upon you.|(Has) Prescribed|your Lord|upon|Himself|the Mercy,|that he|who|does|among you|evil|in ignorance|then|repents|from|after it|and reforms,|then, indeed He|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful."
And thus|We explain|the Verses,|so that becomes manifest|(the) way|(of) the criminals.
Say,|"Indeed I|[I] am forbidden|that|I worship|those whom|you call|from|besides|Allah."|Say,|"Not|I follow|your (vain) desires,|certainly|I would go astray|then,|and not|I (would be)|from|the guided-ones."
Say,|"Indeed, I (am)|on|clear proof|from|my Lord,|while you deny|[with] it.|Not|I have|what|you seek to hasten|of it.|Not|(is) the decision|except|for Allah.|He relates|the truth,|and He|(is the) best|(of) the Deciders."
Say,|"If|that|(were) with me|what|you seek to hasten|of it,|surely would have been decided|the matter|between me|and between you.|And Allah|(is) most knowing|of the wrongdoers.
And with Him|(are the) keys|(of) the unseen,|no (one)|knows them|except|Him.|And He knows|what|(is) in|the land|and in the sea.|And not|falls|of|any leaf|but|He knows it.|And not|a grain|in|the darkness[es]|(of) the earth|and not|moist|and not|dry|but|(is) in|a Record|Clear.
And He|(is) the One Who|takes your (soul)|by the night|and He knows|what|you committed|by the day.|Then|He raises you up|therein,|so that is fulfilled|(the) term|specified.|Then|to Him|will be your return|then|He will inform you|about what|you used to|do.
And He|(is) the Subjugator|over|His slaves,|and He sends|over you|guardians|until|when|comes|(to) anyone of you|the death|take him|Our messengers,|and they|(do) not|fail.
Then|they are returned|to|Allah|their Protector -|[the] True,|Unquestionably,|for Him|(is) the judgment?|And He|(is) swiftest|(of) the Reckoners.
Say,|"Who|saves you|from|darkness[es]|(of) the land|and the sea,|you call Him|humbly|and secretly,|"If|He saves us|from|this,|surely we will be|from|the grateful ones."
Say,|"Allah|saves you|from it|and from|every|distress,|yet|you|associate partners (with Allah)."
Say,|"He|(is) All-Capable|[on]|to|send|upon you|punishment|from|above you|or|from|beneath|your feet|or|(to) confuse you|(into) sects|and make (you) taste -|some of you|violence|(of) others."|See|how|We explain|the Signs|so that they may|understand.
But denied|it -|your people|while it|(is) the truth.|Say,|"I am not|over you|a manager."
For every|news|(is) a fixed time,|and soon|you will know.
And when|you see|those who|engage (in vain talks)|about|Our Verses,|then turn away|from them|until|they engage|in|a talk|other than it.|And if|causes you to forget|the Shaitaan,|then (do) not|sit|after|the reminder|with|the people -|the wrongdoers.
And not|(is) on|those who|fear (Allah)|of|their account|[of]|anything;|but|(for) reminder,|so that they may|fear (Allah).
And leave|those who|take|their religion|(as) a play|and amusement|and deluded them|the life|(of) the world.|But remind|with it,|lest|is given up to destruction|a soul|for what|it (has) earned,|not|(is) for it|from|besides|Allah|any protector|and not|any intercessor.|And if|it offers ransom -|every|ransom,|not|will it be taken|from it.|Those|(are) ones who|are given to destruction|for what|they earned.|For them|(will be) a drink|of|boiling water|and a punishment|painful|because|they used to|disbelieve.
Say,|"Shall we call|from|besides|Allah|what|not|benefits us|and not|harms us,|and we turn back|on|our heels|after|[when]|(has) guided us|Allah?|Like the one|whom (has been) enticed|(by) the Shaitaan|in|the earth,|confused,|he has|companions|who call him|towards|the guidance,|'Come to us.'"|Say,|"Indeed,|(the) Guidance|(of) Allah,|it|(is) the Guidance,|and we have been commanded|that we submit|to (the) Lord|(of) the worlds
And to|establish|the prayer|and fear Him.|And He|(is) the One|to Him|you will be gathered."
And (it is) He|Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|in truth.|And (the) Day|He says,|"Be"|and it is,|His word|(is) the truth.|And for Him|(is) the Dominion|(on the) Day|will be blown|in|the trumpet.|(He is) All-Knower|(of) the unseen|and the seen.|And He|(is) the All-Wise,|the All-Aware.
And when|said|Ibrahim|to his father|Azar,|"Do you take|idols|(as) gods?|Indeed, I|[I] see you|and your people|in|error|manifest."
And thus|We show(ed)|Ibrahim|the kingdom|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|so that he would be|among|the ones who are certain.
So when|covered|over him|the night,|he saw|a star.|He said,|"This|(is) my Lord."|But when|it set,|he said|"Not|(do) I like|the ones that set."
When|he saw|the moon|rising|he said,|"This|(is) my Lord."|But when|it set|he said,|"If|(does) not|guide me|my Lord,|I will surely be|among|the people|who went astray."
When|he saw|the sun|rising|he said,|"This (is)|my Lord,|this (is)|greater."|But when|it set,|he said,|"O my people!|Indeed, I am|free|of what|you associate (with Allah)."
Indeed, I|[I] have turned|my face|to the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|(as) a true monotheist,|and not|I (am)|of|the polytheists.
And argued with him|his people.|He said,|"Do you argue with me|concerning|Allah|while certainly|He has guided me?|And not|(do) I fear|what|you associate|with Him,|unless|[that]|wills|my Lord|anything.|Encompasses|my Lord|every|thing|(in) knowledge.|Then will not|you take heed?
And how|could I fear|what|you associate (with Allah)|while not|you fear|that you|have associated|with Allah|what|not|did He send down|for it|to you|any authority.|So which|(of) the two parties|has more right|to security|if|you|know?"
Those who|believed|and (did) not|mix|their belief|with wrong,|those,|for them,|(is) the security|and they|(are) rightly guided.
And this|(is) Our argument,|We gave it|(to) Ibrahim|against|his people.|We raise|(by) degrees|whom|We will.|Indeed,|your Lord|(is) All-Wise,|All-Knowing.
And We bestowed|to him|Isaac|and Yaqub,|all|We guided.|And Nuh,|We guided|from|before;|and of|his descendents,|Dawood|and Sulaiman|and Ayyub|and Yusuf|and Musa|and Harun.|And thus|We reward|the good-doers.
And Zakariya|and Yahya|and Isa|and Elijah -|all (were)|of|the righteous.
And Ishmael|and Elisha|and Yunus|and Lut,|and all|We preferred|over|the worlds.
And from|their fathers|and their descendents|and their brothers -|and We chose them|and We guided them|to|a path,|straight.
That|(is the) Guidance|(of) Allah,|He guides|with it|whom|He wills|of|His slaves.|But if|they (had) associated partners (with Allah),|surely (would be) worthless|for them|what|they used to|do.
Those -|(are) ones whom|We gave them|the Book|and the judgment|and the Prophethood.|But if|disbelieve|in it|these,|then indeed,|We have entrusted|it|(to) a people|who are not|therein|disbelievers.
Those|(are) ones whom|(have been) guided|(by) Allah|so of their guidance|you follow.|Say,|"Not|I ask you|for it|any reward.|Not|(is) it|but|a reminder|for the worlds."
And not|they appraised|Allah|(with) true|[of his] appraisal|when|they said,|"Not|revealed|(by) Allah|on|a human being|[of]|anything."|Say,|"Who|revealed|the Book|which|brought|[it]|Musa|(as) a light|and guidance|for the people?|You make it|(into) parchments,|you disclose (some of) it|and you conceal|much (of it).|And you were taught|what|not|knew|you|and not|your forefathers."|Say,|"Allah (revealed it)."|Then|leave them|in|their discourse -|playing.
And this|(is) a Book,|We have revealed it,|blessed,|confirming|which|(came) before|its hands,|so that you may warn|(the) mother|(of) the cities|and who|(are) around it.|And those who|believe|in the Hereafter,|they believe|in it,|and they,|over|their prayers|(are) guarding.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (one) who|invents|about|Allah|a lie|or|said,|"It has been inspired|to me"|while not|it was inspired|to him|anything,|and (one) who|said,|"I will reveal|like|what|(has been) revealed|(by) Allah."|And if|you (could) see|when|the wrongdoers|(are) in|agonies|(of) [the] death|while the Angels|(are) stretching out|their hands (saying),|"Discharge|your souls!|Today|you will be recompensed|(with) punishment,|humiliating,|because|you used to|say|against|Allah|other than|the truth|and you were|towards|His Verses|being arrogant."
And certainly|you have come to Us|alone|as|We created you|(the) first|time,|and you have left|whatever|We bestowed (on) you|behind|your backs.|And not|We see|with you|your intercessors|those whom|you claimed|that they (were)|in your (matters)|partners (with Allah).|Indeed,|have been severed (bonds)|between you|and is lost|from you|what|you used to|claim."
Indeed,|Allah|(is the) Cleaver|(of) the grain|and the date-seed.|He brings forth|the living|from|the dead|and brings forth|the dead|from|the living.|That|(is) Allah,|so how|are you deluded?
(He is the) Cleaver|(of) the daybreak|and He has made|the night|(for) rest|and the sun|and the moon|(for) reckoning.|That|(is the) ordaining|(of) the All-Mighty,|the All-Knowing.
And He|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the stars|that you may guide yourselves|with them|in|the darkness[es]|(of) the land|and the sea.|Certainly,|We have made clear|the Signs|for a people|(who) know.
And He|(is) the One Who|(has) produced you|from|a soul,|single,|so (there is) a place of dwelling|and a resting place.|Certainly,|We have made clear|the Signs|for a people|(who) understand.
And He|(is) the One Who|sends down|from|the sky|water,|then We bring forth|with it|vegetation|(of) every|thing.|Then We bring forth|from it|green plant,|We bring forth|from it|grain -|thick clustered.|And from|the date-palm,|from|its spathe|clusters of dates|hanging low.|And gardens|of|grapes|and the olives|and the pomegranates|resembling|and not|resembling.|Look|at|its fruit|when|it bears fruit|and its ripening.|Indeed,|in|that|(are) signs|for a people|(who) believe.
And they make|with Allah|partners -|jinn|though He has created them,|and they falsely attribute|to Him|sons|and daughters|without|knowledge.|Glorified is He|and Exalted|above what|they attribute.
Originator|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|How|can be|for Him|a son|while not|(there) is|for Him|a companion,|and He created|every|thing?|And He|(is) of every|thing|All-Knower.
That|(is) Allah|your Lord,|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|(the) Creator|(of) every|thing,|so worship Him.|And He|(is) on|every|thing|a Guardian.
Not (can)|grasp Him|the visions|but He|(can) grasp|(all) the vision,|and He (is)|the All-Subtle,|the All-Aware.
Verily,|has come to you|enlightenment|from|your Lord.|Then whoever|sees,|then (it is) for his soul,|and whoever|(is) blind|then (it is) against himself.|And not|(am) I|over you|a guardian.
And thus|We explain|the Signs|that they (may) say,|"You have studied,"|and that We (may) make it clear|for a people|who know.
Follow,|what|has been inspired|to you|from|your Lord,|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|and turn away|from|the polytheists.
And if|(had) willed|Allah,|not (they would have)|associated partners (with Him).|And not|We have made you|over them|a guardian,|and not|you|(are) over them|a manager.
And (do) not|insult|those whom|they invoke|from|other than|Allah,|lest they insult|Allah|(in) enmity|without|knowledge.|Thus|We have made fair-seeming|to every|community|their deed.|Then|to|their Lord|(is) their return,|then He will inform them|about what|they used to|do.
And they swear|by Allah|strongest|(of) their oaths|that if|came to them|a sign,|they would surely believe|in it.|Say,|"Only|the signs|(are) with|Allah."|And what|will make you perceive|that [it]|when|it comes|not|they will believe.
And We will turn|their hearts|and their sights|(just) as|not|they believe|in it|(the) first|time.|And We will leave them|in|their transgression|wandering blindly.
And (even) if|[that] We (had)|[We] sent down|to them|the Angels|and spoken to them|the dead|and We gathered|before them|every|thing|face to face,|not|they were|to believe|unless|[that]|wills|Allah.|But|most of them|(are) ignorant.
