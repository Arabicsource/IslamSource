<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Master of the Day of Judgment.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">It is You we worship, and upon You we call for help.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Guide us to the straight path.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">The path of those You have blessed, not of those against whom there is anger, nor of those who are misguided.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Alif, Lam, Meem.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guide for the righteous.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Those who believe in the unseen, and perform the prayers, and give from what We have provided for them.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And those who believe in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you, and are certain of the Hereafter.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">These are upon guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">As for those who disbelieve—it is the same for them, whether you have warned them, or have not warned them—they do not believe.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. They will have a severe torment.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Among the people are those who say, “We believe in God and in the Last Day,” but they are not believers.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">They seek to deceive God and those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves, though they are not aware.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">In their hearts is sickness, and God has increased their sickness. They will have a painful punishment because of their denial.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And when it is said to them, “Do not make trouble on earth,” they say, “We are only reformers.”</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">In fact, they are the troublemakers, but they are not aware.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And when it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools have believed?” In fact, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And when they come across those who believe, they say, “We believe”; but when they are alone with their devils, they say, “We are with you; we were only ridiculing.”</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">It is God who ridicules them, and leaves them bewildered in their transgression.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Those are they who have bartered error for guidance; but their trade does not profit them, and they are not guided.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Their likeness is that of a person who kindled a fire; when it illuminated all around him, God took away their light, and left them in darkness, unable to see.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in fear of death. But God surrounds the disbelievers.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">The lightning almost snatches their sight away. Whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, they stand still. Had God willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. God is capable of everything.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">O people! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you, that you may attain piety.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to God while you know.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like these, and call your witnesses apart from God, if you are truthful.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">But if you do not—and you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And give good news to those who believe and do righteous deeds; that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruit therefrom as sustenance, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they will be given the like of it. And they will have pure spouses therein, and they will abide therein forever.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">God does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, “What did God intend by this example?” He leads astray many thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He misleads thereby only the evildoers.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">Those who violate God’s covenant after its confirmation, and sever what God has commanded to be joined, and commit evil on earth. These are the losers.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">How can you deny God, when you were dead and He gave you life, then He will put you to death, then He will bring you to life, then to Him you will be returned?</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">It is He who created for you everything on earth, then turned to the heaven, and made them seven heavens. And He is aware of all things.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">When your Lord said to the angels, “I am placing a successor on earth.” They said, “Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?” He said, “I know what you do not know.”</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then he presented them to the angels, and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you are sincere.”</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">They said, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise.”</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.” And when he told them their names, He said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">And We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam.” They bowed down, except for Satan. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.</span></div>

<div class="text ltr"><span class="ins">We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as you please, but do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.”</span></div>
