<div class="text ltr">And who believe in this (Qur’an) which has been sent down upon you, O beloved Prophet, (Mohammed <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> peace and blessings be upon him) and what was sent down before you; and are certain of the Hereafter.</div>

<div class="info"> -13 +13 </div>
<div class="text ltr">As for those whose fate is disbelief, whether you warn them or do not warn them <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> it is all one for them; they will not believe.

<div class="info"> -23 +23 </div>
<div class="text ltr">These are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> so their bargain did not profit them, and they did not know how to trade.</div>

<div class="info"> -29,3 +29,3 </div>
<div class="text ltr">The One Who has appointed the earth a base for you, and the sky a canopy <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> and caused water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you; and do not knowingly set up rivals to Allah!</div>

<div class="text ltr">And if you are in any doubt concerning what We have sent down upon Our distinguished bondman (Prophet Mohammed <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> peace and blessings be upon him), bring forth a single surah (chapter) equal to it; and call upon all your supporters, other than Allah, if you are truthful.</div>

<div class="text ltr">Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> and sever what Allah has ordered to join, and who cause turmoil (evil / religious chaos) in the earth; it is they who are the losers.</div>

<div class="text ltr">And (remember) when We ordered the angels to prostrate before Adam, so they all prostrated, except Iblis (Satan <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> devil); he refused and was proud <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> and became a disbeliever.</div>

<div class="text ltr">And We said, “O Adam! You and your wife dwell in this Garden, and eat freely from it wherever you please <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> but do not approach this tree for you will become of those who transgress.”</div>

<div class="text ltr">So the devil destabilised them in it and removed them from where they were <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> and We said, “Go down, one of you is an enemy to the other; and for a fixed time you shall stay on earth and feed in it.”</div>

<div class="info"> -45 +45 </div>
<div class="text ltr">We said, “Go down from Paradise, all of you; then if some guidance comes to you from Me <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> so whoever follows My guidance, for such is neither fear nor any grief.”</div>

<div class="info"> -48 +48 </div>
<div class="text ltr">And accept faith in what I have sent down (the Qur’an), which confirms what is with you (the Torah / Bible), and do not be the first to disbelieve in it <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> and do not exchange My verses for an abject <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> and fear Me alone.</div>

<div class="info"> -58 +58 </div>
<div class="text ltr">And when We made a commitment with Moosa (Moses) for forty nights <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> then behind him you started worshipping the calf, and you were unjust.</div>

<div class="info"> -61 +61 </div>
<div class="text ltr">And when Moosa said to his people, “O my people! You have wronged yourselves by taking the <span class="del">calf, *</span> <span class="ins">calf,*</span> therefore turn in repentance to your Creator, therefore kill each other; this is better for you before your Creator”; He therefore accepted your repentance; indeed He only is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful. (* as your deity for worship)</div>

<div class="info"> -65 +65 </div>
<div class="text ltr">And when We said, “Enter this town and eat freely from what is in it, and enter the gate whilst prostrating, and say, ‘May our sins be forgiven’ <span class="del">-</span> <span class="ins">–</span> We will forgive you your sins; and We will soon increase the reward for the righteous.”</div>
